PrimeDAO's mission is:

Facilitate wide adoption of open finance by coordinating and cultivating projects that promote safety, reliability, liquidity, and open access, while avoiding centralized appropriation of critical financial infrastructure through decentralized governance.

PrimeDAO has four key goals:

1. Liquidity: In DeFi, liquidity must be efficiently utilized such that slippage and user experience are on par with centralized exchanges. Aggregation and layer-2 technologies available today provide powerful tools that realize economies of scale. PrimeDAO’s first product is a liquidity aggregator that provides best-price discovery, slippage reduction, and reliable settlement.
2. Safety: Smart contracts need to be less exploitable than centralized exchanges and must function as intended under all circumstances (e.g. network congestion, rapid market movements). Cross-project audits, increased integration testing, ecosystem bug bounties, and insurance mechanisms can improve overall safety and confidence. As one of its first products, PrimeDAO will prioritize creating a decentralized DeFi Safety Interface that informs and guides DeFi adopters.
3. Reliability: Price feed accuracy and transaction settlement success rates must be on par with those of centralized exchanges. When things go wrong, consensus decisions on remedies must swiftly be enacted so that mainstream users feel as secure as they would using a centralized exchange.
4. Governance: PrimeDAO will govern and allocate resources towards contributors for building, auditing, and maintaining its DeFi mechanisms and products. PrimeDAO aims to form a widely networked organization of interlinked DAOs, builder teams, and key individuals that efficiently coordinate systemic DeFi advancement, forming a sustainable home and neighborhood for DeFi builders and enthusiasts.",Charles Adjovu,PrimeDAO,,,Yes,100.0,100.000
