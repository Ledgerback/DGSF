## What is a DAO?

We define Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) as ==less-hierarchical== %%maybe go with heterarchical?%% communities of stakeholders who collectively govern and coordinate through a combination of algorithmic [^1] ==(citation?)== and social governance mechanisms [^2].   

Stakeholders voluntarily [^3] contribute to shared resources and agree on a set of rules governing these resources to pursue common goals. They collectively define, divide, and allocate tasks and rewards to pursue effective integration of effort [^4].

DAOs are characterized by more equitable forms of ownership [^5] for diverse stakeholder groups, which allow stakeholders to share governance rights to access information and control shared resources.

<!-- DAOs are characterized by distributed ownership, which enables diverse stakeholder groups to share governance rights to ==access, control, and ownership of shared resources==. -->

[^1]: How we see algorithmic rules... (add more) only applicable to on-chain assets and does not require human interpretation.

[^2]: design choice for DAOs to address practical concerns such as costs. 

[^3]: Participants may or may not be bound by formal contracts because... Also, membership is flexible. 

[^4]: The efficiency depends on the goals of the DAOs. 

[^5]: Different ownership structures are possible. concentration of ownership is a spectrum.
