- Hypotheses/Conjectures/Questions (if needed)

## DAO Index

1. Why focus on design features?
   1. <https://geo.coop/sites/default/files/patterns_of_decentralized_organizing.pdf>
   2. Governance processes as design features?
      1. [How Design is Governance](https://www.caseorganic.com/posts/how-design-is-governance)
         1. “When the architecture of a platform is designed with Calm Technology principles in mind, it enables users to self-govern in a way that is efficient and effective.”
2. Principles
	1. Key Principles
	2. Rationale for principles
3. Questionnaire
	1. Rationale for indicators (Is there a need to define indicators?)
	2. <https://github.com/stanford-crfm/fmti/blob/main/fmti_indicators.pdf>
	3. Rationale for questions (and question types (i.e., pass-fail))
		1. [CDP Small and Medium Enterprises 2023 Questionnaire and Reporting Guidance](https://cdn.cdp.net/cdp-production/cms/guidance_docs/pdfs/000/004/490/original/SME-questionnaire-and-reporting-guidance.pdf?1680797731)
		2. <https://github.com/stanford-crfm/fmti/blob/main/fmti_indicators.pdf>
		3. Make sure to include references and notes for questions, in addition to rationale.
		4. Question independence
4. Goals
	1. Further organizational and governance experimentation via digital tools towards community form
	2. Enable experiments in digital self-governance
	3. Drive change in norms (expectation of transparency, use of deliberative methods for governance, etc.)
	4. Living standard that evolves with the DAO ecosystem
	5. Increase shared understanding of DAOs
	6. Standard provides common design components at a global level, while allowing organizations to specialize their development given their local context(s)
	7. Aggregate information on DAO org design practices and other practices
	8. Develop an information reporting standard
	9. Track progress over time
5. Flexibility
	1. Ability to incorporate other standards (e.g., DAOstar) and qualitative and quantitative measures
	2. Can be adapted by end-users to fit their particular context by adding, modifying, or removing principles, and applying weights to principles.
	3. Set of standard response options to improve comparability
6. method
	1. promote adherence to principles through a ranking and monitoring system
		1. refer to web3privacy
7. benefits
	1. improved governance (also helps increase token prices)
	2. include applicable benefits or features from [NGLP_PrinciplesValues_WHITE PAPER](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1We01RHGV2XQi-UZpNkJuOYpfztqF4oavYbNjlFABFp4/edit#heading=h.tz6xy4ga36dg)

## Developing the DAO Index

- Question Independence 
	- principles 
	- indicators  
- translate academic and industry findings into actionable questions, that fit under the principles
