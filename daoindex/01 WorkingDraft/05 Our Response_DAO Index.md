## Developing the DAO Index

- Question Independence 
	- principles 
	- indicators  
- translate academic and industry findings into actionable questions, that fit under the principles
- why yes/no questions?


```markdown
The [principles](https://force11.org/fsci/post/principles/) can be used as:

1. a framework for an agreement between researchers, funders, publishers, librarians, citizen scientists and others active in science and scholarship on how to make research open and participatory for anyone, anywhere
2. a guide to decide how to practice and support research
3. a basis for badging of activities as commons-compliant, by individuals and organizations


The principles themselves do not describe what the scholarly commons should look like and how it should be organized and governed. That is up to participants to decide, using the principles to guide their practices. This can involve choosing existing systems and platforms to carry out and disseminate research, as well as creating new solutions.

## Solution: DAO Index

To help DAOs (or organizations claiming to be DAOs) 

To help resolve the DAO misalignment problem, we have developed the DAO Index, a set of organizing principles, operationalized as a questionnaire.

We promote adherence to the DAO Index principles through a ranking and monitoring platform, avialable as a web UI, of assessments completed with the DAO Index questionnaire.

### Values?

Web3 ethos in an organizaiontal context? Somewaht combining cypherpunk with cooperative values?

### Principles

Is it possible to derive values from the principles?

#### Table
The principles, as of Version 0.9, and the rationale for each principle, are described in the table below.
#### Purposes
The principles are meant to act as: 

1. general guidelines (need a cite) for how an organization can implement practices to align itself with DAO expectations (or with web3 ethos or overarching goal of being a counter-instution or with [our vision of DAOs](https://force11.org/fsci/post/principles/) )
2. a meeting place (or framework for agreement between) for academia, industry, and society to determine practices or norms for organizing as a DAO[^1]
3. a guide for organizing as a DAO
4. universal stanadrd for organization design that should constitute a DAO
5. a standard for norms on how to organize as a DAO
6. a basis for developing organizing standards for DAOs that can eb adapted to fit more specific contexts
7. a basis for determingin if an organization's practices and design is embracing DAO expectations
8. a basis for badging an organization's practices and design as embracing DAO expectations or DAO-compliant, for individuals and organizations

#### Benefits
The principles act as guidelines, but is not prescriptive in determining how an organization puts them into practice.[^1]



This allows for organizations implemeting the principles to be adaptive to their local challenges, changing circumstances and ever-growing complexity.[^2]

> All these systems have tangled, nested structures; it’s complicated all the way down. Delegation of authority and trust to those closest to the action is unavoidable. Top-level managers have little knowledge of, and influence over, the crucial details. Further, adaptive systems produce endless surprises, and it is hard (often impossible) to trace effect back to cause. We cannot really explain why we are in our current situation, and we cannot predict the consequences of our actions. Policy flexibility, leavened with a good dose of humility, is the only way to cope with such change. Finally, complexity brings fragility. Resilience can be improved by ensuring diversity of participants, big and small (although the occasional collapse, just like a major forest fire, is necessary for renewal and reinvention).

> Such principles can guide policy-making. Applied to the regulation of video services, for example, the delegation principle suggests that regulators look to web participants to generate content in local languages before imposing national production quotas. The flexibility principle implies that they should give content providers a chance to invent web-appropriate solutions to public-interest mandates, such as accessibility for the disabled, and only regulate to the extent that the community does not solve the problem. Finally, the diversity principle suggests that a multiplicity of creators is more likely to generate sustainable social value than a small number of heavily regulated producers; market entry and competition are key.

> The governance choice here is between principles and rules – that is, between general guidelines for action and detailed if-then instructions. Principles are not tacit: they are an expression of our shared insights about managing a resource. However, principles are silent about how they should be implemented in a specific situation. This delegates power to a local decision-maker to respond appropriately to conditions that a high-level policy maker could not foresee (or, indeed, cannot see). General principles can become more specific when they guide short-term actions. For example, someone setting high-level policy would implement the flexibility principle by focusing on broadly defined ends and not specifying means, while a regulator would devise specific, but still technology- and business-model-neutral, rules.

> Why principles and not rules? Regulators have no choice but to make it up as they go along when coping with rapidly changing systems. Principles guide decisions without relying on rules that will be obsolete before their ink has dried. We should not expect perfection from principles – just better results than could be achieved with either fleetingly relevant rules, or giving regulators complete discretion.

the principles are generally derived from groupin the questions, and from insights from academic and grey literature.

The principles are also generally conformant with toher deisgn thinking frameworks, such as Kelsie Nabben's [Dao Design Patterns](https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/dao-design-patterns), ...

The questoinnaire operationalizes the principles, thereby providing measurable expectations for DAO organizing. 

The questoinnaire assesses adherence to the principles, which

The qeustions help connect/bridge the vision of DAOs to real-world practices, by helping identifying practices that can be implemented to reach the DAO vision, generally by deirving insights from academic and grey literature.
