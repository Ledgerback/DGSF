## Developing the DAO Index

- Question Independence 
	- principles 
	- indicators  
- translate academic and industry findings into actionable questions, that fit under the principles
- why yes/no questions?


```markdown
The [principles](https://force11.org/fsci/post/principles/) can be used as:

1. a framework for an agreement between researchers, funders, publishers, librarians, citizen scientists and others active in science and scholarship on how to make research open and participatory for anyone, anywhere
2. a guide to decide how to practice and support research
3. a basis for badging of activities as commons-compliant, by individuals and organizations


The principles themselves do not describe what the scholarly commons should look like and how it should be organized and governed. That is up to participants to decide, using the principles to guide their practices. This can involve choosing existing systems and platforms to carry out and disseminate research, as well as creating new solutions.

## Solution: DAO Index

To help DAOs (or organizations claiming to be DAOs) 

To help resolve the DAO misalignment problem, we have developed the DAO Index, a set of organizing principles (*need to define principles*), operationalized as a questionnaire.

We promote adherence to the DAO Index principles through a ranking and monitoring platform, avialable as a web UI, of assessments completed with the DAO Index questionnaire.

### Values?

- thoughts?
	- Web3 ethos in an organizaiontal context? Somewaht combining cypherpunk with cooperative values?
	- any need to mention? Or just approach like POSI?

### Principles

Is it possible to derive values from the principles?

#### Table
The principles, as of Version 0.9, and the rationale for each principle, are described in the table below.

[table]
#### Purposes
The principles are meant to act as: 

1. general guidelines (need a cite) for how an organization can implement practices to align itself with DAO expectations (or with web3 ethos or overarching goal of being a counter-instution or with [our vision of DAOs](https://force11.org/fsci/post/principles/) )
2. a meeting place (or framework for agreement between) for academia, industry, and society to determine practices or norms for organizing as a DAO[^1]
3. a guide for organizing as a DAO
4. universal stanadrd for organization design that should constitute a DAO
5. a standard for norms on how to organize as a DAO
6. a basis for developing organizing standards for DAOs that can eb adapted to fit more specific contexts
7. a basis for determingin if an organization's practices and design is embracing DAO expectations
8. a basis for badging an organization's practices and design as embracing DAO expectations or DAO-compliant, for individuals and organizations

### Questionnaire
The questoinnaire operationalizes the principles, thereby providing a means for setting measurable expectations for DAO organizing (or design components for DAOs). 

The questoinnaire assesses adherence to the principles, through a set of indicators and questions for each principle.

The indicator acts as a category or signal for identifying deisgn choices in DAOs, and the question is a specific inqiurity, generally following from the indicator, about a DAO's design choices (or design components).

The questions help connect/bridge the vision of DAOs to real-world practices, by helping identifying design choices/components (and practices embedding those design choices) that can be implemented to reach the DAO vision, generally by deriving insights from DAO-related academic and grey literature.

The questions are designed to be independent, such that the answer or response to one question does not depend on the answer to another question. 


#### Questionnaire V0.9

You can find the Questionnaire, as of Version 0.9 (V0.9), in the table below, including the rationale for each question.

#### Glossary

You can find the definitions for terms used in the questionnaire in the table below.

#### Assessment Process

The DAO Index assessment is a meticulous six-step procedure designed to ensure accuracy, transparency, and active participation from the DAO community. The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Initial Draft Assessment**: Utilizing the DAO Index Questionnaire, we conduct an initial assessment based on publicly available information about a DAO. This stage forms the foundation of our analysis.
2. **Draft Publication**: The initial assessment findings are then published on the DAO Index Dashboard. Additionally, a comprehensive write-up detailing this preliminary evaluation is made available for public viewing and feedback.
3. **Community Engagement**: In this critical phase, we actively engage with representatives from the DAO under review. Their insights and feedback on both the DAO Index and the draft assessment are solicited to ensure a well-rounded evaluation.
4. **Final Assessment Compilation**: The final assessment integrates feedback received in the previous step. It also considers any new information or developments that have emerged since the initial assessment, ensuring the final report is up-to-date and reflective of the latest DAO dynamics.
5. **Final Assessment Dissemination**: Similar to the draft stage, the final assessment is published on the DAO Index Dashboard for transparency. A detailed write-up, encompassing all the insights and conclusions from the entire assessment process, is also made publicly available.
6. **Ongoing Review Cycle**: Recognizing the dynamic nature of DAOs, this step involves revisiting and reassessing DAOs periodically. This iterative approach ensures that the DAO Index remains relevant and accurately reflects the evolving landscape of DAO governance.

#### Scoring

As of Version 0.9, responses are scored using the following method:

#### Gradio Web UI (can remove)

In development is a Gradio web UI (can link to Airtable via API) for assessing organizations using the questionnaire.

#### User Guide

We developed a user guide to aid analysts (or auditors) in using the DAO Index questionnaire V0.8.

#### Scorecard Toolkit (probably do not need to mention tools here)

### Dashboard

The DAO Index dashboard is a publicly accessible, web-based user interface (UI) for querying and filtering DAO Index ratings and the DAO Index data repository (completed assessments, materials cited), and finding DAO Index-related resources.

Through the dashboard, anyone can monitor DAOs ??? %%Need to think about how people can use the dashboard%%

You can see an image of each webpage below or in the appendix.

### Data repository

*Can include graphic from slidedeck*

The data repository is a library of DAO Index-related datasets.

The data repository includes the following datasets:

1. Materials or Evidence dataset: 
2. Assessments dataset:
3. Scores dataset:
4. Literature dataset:

### Open data and participatory design approach (maybe move to benefits section)

Through an open data/access approach, we can provide transparency on how the DAO Index is developed and how DAOs are assessed with the DAO Index questionnaire.

Through a particiaptory design approach, we can encourage and collate ideas and other feedback from members of academia, industry, and the public on the DAO Index principles, and how they are operationalized through the questionnaire.
## How the DAO Index was developed (is this needed? If so, in this section or another section?)

Initilaly, the questionnaire was devloped by generating questions then, grouping the questions based on a principle.

Generally, quesitons were generated from drawing insights from academic and/or grey literature (from any discipline and industry vertical for DAOs), that better informed us of design choices for DAOs.
## How DAO Index addresses the problem statement

The DAO Index addresses the problem statement in the following ways:

1. **Transparency Poverty**: The DAO Index addresses transparency poverty by making data from assessments open access, and unearthing important information, that should be publicly known, through the assessment process.
2. **Lack of Measurable Expectations**: The DAO Index addresses the lack of measurable expecations by operaitonalziing the principles through the questonnaire, with most questions seeking or enforcing a design choice that can be met through a spectrum of practicies (some exceptions such as BSP-02 and BSP-01)
3. **Conceptual Opacity**: The DAO Index addresses concepcutal opacity through the principles and the particiaptory design approach for the principles and questionnaire by encouraging collective input from members of academia, industry, and the public on the set of principles and how they are operationalized through the questionnaire
4. **Regression to the code**: The DAO Index addresses regression to the code by highlighting design compoenetns for developing social infrastructure (or norms and practices), while balancing the use of Web3 technolgoy for optimizing operations and governance (primarily throguh the OT principle). In other words, balancing trustware with socialware.

## Benefits of approach

> [**They seek to provide enough structure and information to engender trust, guide investments, and incentivize alignment with shared principles and standards, but not so much structure and information that it creates artificial barriers to entry for these marketplaces.**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1We01RHGV2XQi-UZpNkJuOYpfztqF4oavYbNjlFABFp4/edit)

outline:

1. principles, not rules
2. scope is spectrum of activities
3. incentivizing alignment through ratings and rankings (or simply benchmarking through ratings)
4. open access data repository
5. participatory approach on determining new versions of the DAO Index principles and questionnaire (question pool)
6. conformant with, or flexible enough to accomodate, other DAO design thinking frameworks
7. living standard
8. translation of academic and grey literature into actionable recommendations (or actionable knowledge) (can also say increasing the impact of research and researchers here) 
9. assessment process allows for feedback from external stakeholders (researchers, DAO operators, the public)
10. DAO Index can be adapted to fit more specific circumstances
11. identify best practices (given a design choice?)

### principles, not rules

The principles act as guidelines, but are not prescriptive in determining how an organization puts them into practice.[^1]



This allows for organizations implemeting the principles to be adaptive to their local challenges, changing circumstances and ever-growing complexity.[^2]

> All these systems have tangled, nested structures; it’s complicated all the way down. Delegation of authority and trust to those closest to the action is unavoidable. Top-level managers have little knowledge of, and influence over, the crucial details. Further, adaptive systems produce endless surprises, and it is hard (often impossible) to trace effect back to cause. We cannot really explain why we are in our current situation, and we cannot predict the consequences of our actions. Policy flexibility, leavened with a good dose of humility, is the only way to cope with such change. Finally, complexity brings fragility. Resilience can be improved by ensuring diversity of participants, big and small (although the occasional collapse, just like a major forest fire, is necessary for renewal and reinvention).

> Such principles can guide policy-making. Applied to the regulation of video services, for example, the delegation principle suggests that regulators look to web participants to generate content in local languages before imposing national production quotas. The flexibility principle implies that they should give content providers a chance to invent web-appropriate solutions to public-interest mandates, such as accessibility for the disabled, and only regulate to the extent that the community does not solve the problem. Finally, the diversity principle suggests that a multiplicity of creators is more likely to generate sustainable social value than a small number of heavily regulated producers; market entry and competition are key.

> The governance choice here is between principles and rules – that is, between general guidelines for action and detailed if-then instructions. Principles are not tacit: they are an expression of our shared insights about managing a resource. However, principles are silent about how they should be implemented in a specific situation. This delegates power to a local decision-maker to respond appropriately to conditions that a high-level policy maker could not foresee (or, indeed, cannot see). General principles can become more specific when they guide short-term actions. For example, someone setting high-level policy would implement the flexibility principle by focusing on broadly defined ends and not specifying means, while a regulator would devise specific, but still technology- and business-model-neutral, rules.

> Why principles and not rules? Regulators have no choice but to make it up as they go along when coping with rapidly changing systems. Principles guide decisions without relying on rules that will be obsolete before their ink has dried. We should not expect perfection from principles – just better results than could be achieved with either fleetingly relevant rules, or giving regulators complete discretion.

_

the principles are generally derived from groupin the questions, and from insights from academic and grey literature.


### scope is spectrum of activities
The use of pass/fail questions (though, any question type can be used (refer to limesurvey)) is primarily to first understand the spectrum of design choices, given the principles, that are possible. The principles are ment to be general guidleines, thus allowing for organizations to choose *multiple means to achieve multiple ends* (or to account for organizational differences).

Once we have a better understnading of the spectrum of activities that make sense for DAO design choices (or components), i.e., once we have acuqired enough qualitivies insights (cite vogshmir here), we can then create more precise questions, qualitative or quantaitative, in the future.

include applicable benefits or features from [NGLP_PrinciplesValues_WHITE PAPER](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1We01RHGV2XQi-UZpNkJuOYpfztqF4oavYbNjlFABFp4/edit#heading=h.tz6xy4ga36dg) and why this method may be good

### benchmarking

Individuals and insitutions (DAOs included) can see how DAOs are benchmarked, both against previous assessments and against other organizations.[^3]

We seek to incentivize DAOs to further align their diesng chocies with the DAO Index over time, prmiarily through a rating and ranking system based on scores from the assessment process, and publishing promotional materials such as blog posts and badges or rating labels.[^3]
### conformant with other design thinking frameworks

The principles are also generally conformant with toher deisgn thinking frameworks, such as Kelsie Nabben's [Dao Design Patterns](https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/dao-design-patterns), ...

*and possibly Shermin Vogshmir's DAO design thinking framework*.[^4]
