## Institutional Legitimacy for DAOs through Proper Organizational Design

The institutional environment that DAOs operate in influences the organizational structures [@desantola2017]. As DAOs try to grow, they may need to conform to templates of organizational design embedded in the institutional environment [@desantola2017]. Such external expectations, coupled with institutionalized expectations based on the experiences of varying stakeholder groups in DAOs, could shape the future of DAOs as a viable form of organizing. By delineating the principles in the DAO Index and synthesizing the responses from stakeholders, we contribute to clarifying the expectations for DAOs' organizational design. Our goal is to inform the field of DAOs to develop in ways that can establish legitimacy for a wider group of audiences and garner more resources from key stakeholders. 

It also addresses the concerns about "decentralization theater" when it comes to governance in DAOs. And, potentially, it would be better for emerging DAOs to follow what everyone else is doing to appear legitimate, if the "what", such as the principles we propose here, are actually  contributing to better practice of decentralized governance in DAOs.

When institutional improvements are available to an entire category of workers, whether they are members of said networks or not, they can be considered public goods since they improve conditions for the whole ecosystem. Quality standards for producers are an example of this [12]. In the Ethereum ecosystem the EIP process and the ERC token standard are good examples of public goods in the making. Extending technical and social standards for labor relations is another way to generate positive externalities for the web3 ecosystem. For this to happen, however, there needs to be a collective effort by industry leaders and organizations in facilitating, by example, the establishment of the normative basis that valorizes this aspect of DAO work.”

### Outline

1. Standards & Public Goods
2. Institutional Legitimization
### Prose

Our contributions include:

1. developing a public good (DAO Index resources and data repository) to support the Web3 ecosystem, and more specifically, the DAO ecosystem
2. providing a set of principles that can act as good constraints for public goods production (maybe say this is an institutional primitive?)
3. developing a standard for how DAOs should be organized, and mapping how current DAOs can work towards this standard
4. standardizing DAO governance for the common good

#### DAO Assessment Frameworks
First, there are other DAO governance assessment frameworks, other than the DAO Index. 

We compare these frameworks with our own, note the advantages and disadvantages of both (or similarities and dissimilarities of both), and how the DAO Index can possibly complement the other frameworks.

The other DAO governance assessment frameworks we found include:

The DAOmeter is ...

In [DAO Meter Research Methodology](https://daometer.vercel.app/methodology), the authors describe how they developed the DAOmeter, an assessment framework for assessing organizational or governance maturity in DAOs.[^1] 

%% Can mention how we get similar results to DAOmeter, and also how our assessments can use their results to help answer questions%%

In *[DAO Vulnerabilities](https://medium.com/block-science/dao-vulnerabilities-509ff074a296)*, Kelsie Nabben developed a questionnaire for moving "from categorization and prioritization of governance vulnerabilities to fixing and improving" for addressing the internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) threats and vulnerabilities.

The questionnaire developed by Nabben is described below.

```markdown
1. What is the objective of the DAO community? (goal of systems and goal of individuals within it)

2. What are its defining cultural factors? Have you initiated a cultural build, and what does this look like?

3. Is the strategy short term or long-term? (seasonal, or for a long-standing purpose).

4. Are you focused on product innovation or organizational innovation? (doing both simultaneously is hard, as governance researcher at BlockScience Burrrata points out).

5. What is the intended size and scale of the DAO?

6. How does trust and reputation work in the DAO? How do you want it to work (trust minimization towards “trustless”, or trustful infrastructure?)

7. How does labor and accountability work in the DAO? How do you want it to? (core work, care work. Responsibility, accountability, and recourse. Tacit or implicit incentive structures and rewards, etc.).

8. Do your governance structures and ways people can participate leave you vulnerable to collusion attacks?

9. Do your governance structures and mechanisms and ways people can participate leave you vulnerable to bribery attacks?
```

Though, not applied, the questionnaire is a good example of moving from conceptual to empirical.


In *[When is a DAO decentralized?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08160)*, the authors developed an assessment framework for assessing when a DAO is considered sufficiently decentralized.

In *[The DAO Health Pulse Survey](https://talentdao.substack.com/p/nodw-16-developing-the-dao-health?r=b3uxm&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)*, the authors


Second, there are other assessment frameworks outside of the DAO ecosystem that influenced the development of the DAO Index.

#### DAO Design Frameworks
In [Dao Design Patterns](https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/dao-design-patterns), Kelsie Nabben describes the design components for a DAO.


## Use-cases and Expected/Desired Outcomes (is this section necessary?)
## Assumptions and Limitations

### Notes
 3. DAO definition (or DAO conceptualization)

1. Outside-in view of assessment
	1. Reliance on publicly available information
2. Approach may be inadequate
3. Principles chosen may not be representative of ideals for how a DAO should be operated and governed
4. absence of standardized documentation (like SEC's K-10)
5. absence of measurements of crucial metrics (at least publicly)
6. small dataset
7. lack of systematic research approach to developing principles and questionnaire
8. scoring method may be inadequate because ... 

## Future Directions

1. Research Questions
2. Designing Principles
	1. developing a more systematic method for collecting and analyzing literature to find and select principles (same for questions)
3. Scoring
	1. developing a more systematic method for scoring responses to the questionnaire
