## Institutional Legitimacy for DAOs through Proper Organizational Design

The institutional environment that DAOs operate in influences the organizational structures [@desantola2017]. As DAOs try to grow, they may need to conform to templates of organizational design embedded in the institutional environment [@desantola2017]. Such external expectations, coupled with institutionalized expectations based on the experiences of varying stakeholder groups in DAOs, could shape the future of DAOs as a viable form of organizing. By delineating the principles in the DAO Index and synthesizing the responses from stakeholders, we contribute to clarifying the expectations for DAOs' organizational design. Our goal is to inform the field of DAOs to develop in ways that can establish legitimacy for a wider group of audiences and garner more resources from key stakeholders. 

It also addresses the concerns about "decentralization theater" when it comes to governance in DAOs. And, potentially, it would be better for emerging DAOs to follow what everyone else is doing to appear legitimate, if the "what", such as the principles we propose here, are actually  contributing to better practice of decentralized governance in DAOs.

	   1. “Instead we believe that this scenario fits squarely within the mission for public goods funding on Ethereum. When institutional improvements are available to an entire category of workers, whether they are members of said networks or not, they can be considered public goods since they improve conditions for the whole ecosystem. Quality standards for producers are an example of this [12]. In the Ethereum ecosystem the EIP process and the ERC token standard are good examples of public goods in the making. Extending technical and social standards for labor relations is another way to generate positive externalities for the web3 ecosystem. For this to happen, however, there needs to be a collective effort by industry leaders and organizations in facilitating, by example, the establishment of the normative basis that valorizes this aspect of DAO work.”

## Assumptions and Limitations

- 
 3. DAO definition (or DAO conceptualization)
	1. Is there a need for a definition (or can we simply focus on practices (or can we define daos based on their practices rather than imaginary or conceptualizations)?

		  1. “To avoid mission creep, data cooperatives need to adhere to the globally shared definition of what makes an organization a cooperative:”
	2. Definition should be broad enough to allow others to more narrowly define DAOs for their local contexts?
