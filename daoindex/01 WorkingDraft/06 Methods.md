## Data Collection

We conducted 11 assessments with the DAO Index Version 0.9. We generated our responses by completing the questionnaire ourselves for each DAO evaluated.

We based our responses on publicly available information provided directly (or primary source) by the DAO evaluated, or indirectly by a third party source (secondary source).
