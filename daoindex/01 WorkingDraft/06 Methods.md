## Data Collection

We conducted 11 assessments with the DAO Index Version 0.9. We generated our responses by completing the questionnaire ourselves for each DAO evaluated.

We based our responses on publicly available information provided directly (or primary source) by the DAO evaluated, or indirectly by a third party source (secondary source).

We selected the 11 DAOs of varying governance structures, missions, industries, etc., to see the universality of the quesiotnnaire (i.e., how often the questions were inapplicable to a particular organization).

You can find a table of the DAO charactersitics from DeepDAO and [name of other data sources] below.
