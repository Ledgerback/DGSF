## Data Collection 

- Purposeful Sampling Strategy %%is this exploratory case study research? In addition to deriving insights from the literature for principles%%
	- Why the 10 DAOs
	- Generalizability 
- How we conducted the assessment 
- Literature Collection? %%sporadic at best. Not a systematic collection %%
- %%can say overall method is: first step is to collect literature to find principles/ideals (that we prefer?) and posible questions, and second step is to use quesitonnaire to get info back like an exploratory case study%%
## Data Analysis

- Assessment Results Analysis
- Instrument Validity Checks
	- Validity checks
		- External: question independence
	- Reliability checks
		- Internal check: Inter-rater reliability

## Literature Collection (can rename to literature review; can move to its own section)

%%may need a more formal method for literature review%%

We collected academic and grey literature to help identify %%or design principles%% principles (or ideals) %%or search literature to find docs on principles and pick appropriate ones from there? Or for how to develop design principles?%% for how DAOs should be designed (or operated and governed) %%or expected characteristics%%. Additionally, to identify current issues facing DAOs.

You can find our collection of literature for each principle, and the snippets (or highlights quotes) from each article in the table below.

The DAO Index helps focus on 1) how to design DAOs, and 2) how to assess DAOs. 



## Literature Analysis

%%may need to do a thematic analysis as well? Refer to https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=889127119117085066065107068115100104036009058007026037005120121009020093073088028087018123040104049123008009109030002085082097001008088038013095101067031090117023006005066077104094106084108000006011031118004006017108096026011073117102006079000114022074&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE%%

Then, from the literature, we extracted snippets (or highlights quotes) from the articles, which better informed us of principles or ideals that would be appropriate and universal (mission-, size-, and profit-independent) for DAOs %%not sure if snippets are even needed%%. The same for the questions chosen for the questionnaire.

We identified which principles to keep or drop, based on our exploratory case studies conducted with the questionnaire, to see if we could connect the principles with real-world practices (or see how and if the principles could be interpreted in the real world (and any patterns for doing so)).


## Data Collection

We conducted eleven assessments with the DAO Index Version 0.9. We generated our responses by completing the questionnaire ourselves for each DAO evaluated (i.e., conducting a draft assessment).

We based our responses on publicly available information provided directly (or primary source) by the DAO evaluated, or indirectly by a third party source (secondary source).

You can find our data sources in the table below.

[table]

We selected eleven DAOs of varying ownership and governance structures, missions, industry verticals, etc., to see the universality of the questionnaire (i.e., how often the questions were inapplicable to a particular organization).

You can find a table of the DAO characteristics from DeepDAO and [name of other data sources] below.

## Data Analysis

### Assessment Results
We conducted the following analyses on the draft assessments (refer to Analysis notebook; results of analysis notebook should be included in Findings section):

1. examined the correlation of responses (for question independence?)
2. created radar charts for each DAO based on their scores per principle
3. created a bar chart of each DAO's overall score
3. created a bar chart of each DAO's scores per principle
5. created a scores table for overall scores and scores per principle for all DAOs assessed
6. count of questions where no information could be found to answer the question
7. count of questions inapplicable to a DAO
8. %%?determined areas of improvement for the questionnaire?%%

### Instrument Analysis

We conducted the following analyses on the questionnaire:

1. Inter-rater reliability
2. Question independence
