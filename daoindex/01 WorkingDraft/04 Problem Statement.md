## Empirical Challenge(s)

1. Transparency poverty
   1. [Web3 Work research report: The DAO contributor's perspective](https://otherinternet.substack.com/p/web3-work-research-report)
      1. “Transparent work processes vs. transparent technologies. Another issue that contributes to burnout and exhaustion is the lack of transparency when it comes to work processes, and the information asymmetries between contributors and former core teams. These issues cannot be addressed solely by transparent technology.”
   2. [Social Security for Web3 Work: A Preliminary Specification of the Design and Deployment of Solidarity Primitives for DAO Contributors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4596552)
      1. “While extensive information resides on-chain and within forums, there appears to be a lack of willingness to transparently discuss challenges and phase-shifts among DAOs and web3 organizations. This paradox of transparency particularly applies to discussions of failure and loss, perhaps in view of the prevailing focus on success that characterizes the space. Building a culture of honesty based on the open sourcing of information and processes are vital components of a thriving open ecosystem – particularly for non-technical roles and fields (i.e. design, facilitation, org research and internal practices).”

3. Community-washing
   1. <https://twitter.com/RohitMalekar/status/1706012892410114381>
4. Lack of shared understanding of DAOs as a theoretical and applied concept

   4. [The ins and outs of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) unraveling the definitions, characteristics, and emerging developments of DAOs - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720923000180)
      1. “There is a steep rise in the number of perceived DAOs over time, as shown in Fig. 1. This number is disputable, as DAOs are ambiguously defined [14,15]. Ambiguous DAO definitions may lead to some confusion over whether a certain organization is a DAO or not. Clarity in the DAO definition is important for both users and researchers. For users, what defines a DAO can have consequences on their decision if they would like to participate in such an organization, whereas for researchers, conceptual clarity is key for understanding and analyzing an empirical situation.”
      2. “As DAOs are multifaceted, various definitions approach DAOs from different perspectives, ranging from functional, organizational form, and purpose perspectives to technical creation, setup, and scientific and practical perspectives. There is no clear consensus about what makes up a DAO in the literature [14], which can be attributed to its emerging nature. In the next subsection, we discuss the similarities and differences in the definitions and characteristics of DAOs by summarizing and developing the functional and technological perspectives of DAOs. We then analyze the extracted and observed characteristics to identify the most common characteristics in the existing definitions. We create a comprehensive definition by combining these common characteristics with the observed characteristics in our empirical research.”

      1. “Not only would such efforts improve working conditions for DAO contributors but they would also contribute to reinforcing the endogenous and exogenous legitimacy of the space, both within web3 and toward external regulators [5].”
5. Decentralization-washing

7. Lack of DAO benchmarks (or lack of standards and best practices around organizing as a DAO)
   1. [Yuhas, Alyssa (2023) _DAOs & Co-ops: How to learn from the past to create viable economic communities for the future_](https://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/3985/1/Yuhas_Alyssa_2023_MDes_SFI_MRP.pdf)
      1. “Finally, continued research could focus on developing DAO benchmarks, like B Corp standards, to help individuals understand the level of cooperative governance, community, and accountability present in DAOs.”
   2. [Ways to improve the ownership economy — Forefront](https://ff.mirror.xyz/ZRsr5HZMfbHOEe2lIYoWinRCI65NlvDW_QzEu1rn7As)
      1. “I would suggest the development of a Community Ownership Assessment like the B Corp Impact Assessment, which scores companies based on criteria like impact on workers, community, customers, and corporate governance. A Community Ownership Assessment could take into account forms of transparency, equitable token distribution, and democratic participation.”

   4. [How Plutocracy Undermines the DAO | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/how-plutocracy-undermines-the-dao)
      1. “We understand that DAOs are individual and beautiful. But we still need to move toward some institutionalized principles that can be considered the "best." Or at least the most "right" ones.”
   5. [Cooperatives: the fulfilment of big tech’s empty promises - jason wiener | p.c.](https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-the-fulfilment-of-big-techs-empty-promises/)
      1. “I see both DAO projects that reflect a stakeholder ownership model, and also a number of projects that are heavily financed by outside, profit-driven investors. I am concerned that without the adoption of a clear set of principles, like the cooperative movements have done with the Rochdale principles and the Mondragon principles, Web3 will be overtaken by those investors missing the mark on what the Web3 ethos of shared ownership and decentralization. Shared ownership models offer a promising alternative to traditional business models that prioritize profits over social welfare. Web3 technologies and platform cooperatives can help to overcome the hurdles that these models face, and create a more equitable and sustainable economy that benefits everyone. We must work together to promote and support these models, and ensure that our economy is serving the needs of all people.”

11. open and transparent systems are not enough
	1. refer to  [Decentralized Crypto Governance? Transparency and Concentration in Ethereum Decision-Making](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4691000)

can say challenges above stem from the roots of misalignment (or from the misalignment of what DAOs ought to be, and what they are)

or say that there is misalignment of what DAOs ought to be, and what they are, and that here are examples or the effects of this misalignment (transparency poverty, etc.), and through solution, we can push DAOs towards re-aligning with ideal or imaginary.
