# Organizational Design of DAOs 
- How do DAOs operate? 
- How should DAOs operate?
	- the principles underlying the operation
- Best organizational design for DAOs 
	- goal: embody Web 3 ethos
		- create community-based organizations with less hierarchy 
		- blockchain-based technologies 

## What is the goal of organizational design for DAOs?
How to design DAOs, or to find ways for organizations to embody values and practices to become DAOs, is an emerging topic of interest. 

For DAOs, we assume that the organizational design (OD) goal is to:

%%@chaarles: Which goal do you like the most?%%

1. find (or experiment) and implement values and principles that develop, sustain, and scale DAOs, %%through a variety of organizational structures%%, to a large and diverse group of participants.
2. provide meta-narrative logic[^1] (values and principles) to develop, sustain, and scale DAOs, %%through a variety of organizational structures%%, to a large and diverse group of participants.
3. optimizing use of blockchain and other Web3 tech, and other computational tools, to assist or support governance and operations in organizations[^2], and to help organizations implement more equitable forms of ownership and democratic forms of governance
4. govern socio-technical systems through Nearly Decentralized Organizations (NDOs)[^3]
5. balance human-machine governance of organizations (or [balance on- and off-chain rules and logic for organizations](https://orca.mirror.xyz/T70CmuhX95ubkw_JHOxSEy8d_EFeYXgtJnF13mPtaZE)), and further the resilience of [NDOs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3959703)
6. meta-narrative logic (values and principles), to ensure use of Web3 tech does not [re-invent issues with Big Tech and surveillance capitalism](https://p2pmodels.eu/wp-content/uploads/whitepaper_p2pmodels.pdf)

%%@charles: What do you think about the second paragraph? More of the broader tech ecosystem goal, reflecting Web3's (from Ethereum's viewpoint and even Fediverse (e.g., Mastodon)) broader goal?%%

In doing so, DAOs show that these alternative forms of organizing are viable models against the traditional BigTech model of venture-backed startup, and should assist in providing institutional infrastructure for aligning human values with innovation trajectories or technological progress, to avoid the social harms associated with BigTech.

The Web3 ethos is (refer to ethereum whitepaper)
