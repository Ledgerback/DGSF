No

#### Points
50

#### Reasoning
Compound does not require members to undergo a verification process to prove that they have a unique digital digital identity.  Any Ethereum address can hold COMP tokens because the COMP Token implements the ERC-20 standard, without any modifications requiring a verified address. Additionally, members can delegate COMP tokens to themselves or a third party, who need not necessarily hold COMP tokens.

### BSP-11: Does the DAO have a shared ownership model?


#### Answer
Yes

#### Points
100

#### Reasoning
The Compound protocol is primarily meant to be governed by users of the protocol. Though, the tradability of the COMP token will likely lead to more retail investors having more influence on the Compound protocol than users. So, it is possible to say that the main stakeholder groups with an ownership interest are users and retail investors.

#### Answer
Partial

#### Points
50

#### Reasoning
Gitcoin does not require GTC token holders to have a unique digital identity. However, Gitcoin Stewards are required to provide a brief introduction or bio of themselves as part of their Steward nomination, including: 1) Gitcoin Username, 2) ETH Address, 3) Discord Handle (optional), 4) Statement of Intention / Your Values & Reasons for Joining, and 5) Your Web3 Qualifications / Skills. Additionally, GTC holders can verify their own or someone else's identity via GTC staking.

#### Answer
Partial

#### Points
50

#### Reasoning
Gitcoin's workstreams are expected to have management roles (workstreams are expected to be led by a Steward), but there is a lack of information on how management roles are defined. Additionally, a seat on the Cross Stream DAO Operations can be considered a management role.

#### Evidence

### BSP-09: Does the DAO use a participatory governance model?


#### Answer
Partial

#### Points
50

#### Reasoning
Gitcoin has a particiaptory governance system. Gitcoin utilizes a referendum system where GTC token holders vote on proposals. Regarding voting, any GTC token holder can vote on a proposal, either by voting themselves or dlegating their voting power to a Gitcoin Steward (i.e., proxy voting). Regarding proposal drafting, it appears that any GTC token holder can submit a proposal for deliberation. Though, it is unclear if holding GTC tokens is required to submit a proposal. Lastly, any GTC token holder can become a Gitcoin Steward through self-nomination and complying with the rules for Gitcoin Stewards.

### BSP-09: Does the DAO use a participatory governance model?


#### Answer
Partial

#### Points
50

#### Reasoning
Optimism utilizes a bicameral referendum (or proposal-based) system. The governing bodies are the Token House and the Citizens House. OP holders in the Token House vote on the following proposals:
- Governance fund grants
- Protocol upgrades
- Inflation adjustment
- Director removal
- Treasury appropriations
- Rights protection

The Citizens' House is responsible for retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) . The Token House utilizes a token-based weighted scheme, while the Citizens' House utilizes a one-identity, one-vote scheme. In the Token House, OP token holders can vote themselves or delegate to another OP token holder, a delegate. There are no restrictions on who can become a delegate in the Token House. In the Citizens' House, OP token holders who hold a voting badge can vote in RetroPGF rounds. It does not appear to be that delegation is allowed in the Citizens' House.

OP holders in the Token House also approves topic-specific committees to advise OP holders and delegates on proposals.

#### Answer

#### Points

#### Reasoning
PrimeDAO has a shared ownership model where ownership (governance (REP) and economic rights (PRIME)) is shared among ambassadors and contributors (can be an individual or organization). Generally, a person can vest their PRIME tokens to generate REP tokens. A person can receive PRIME tokens for contributing as an ambassador or contributor, and can then in turn vest their PRIME tokens for REP tokens. Thus, members of PrimeDAO can elect to participate in the DAO's governance systems. It appears that anyone can earn PRIME or REP tokens, as long as they make a contribution.

### CPB-02: Does the DAO make an explicit, clearly articulated statement of its purpose, values and norms?


#### Answer
Yes

#### Points
100

#### Reasoning
PrimeDAO clearly articulates its purpose, values and norms on its Introduction page on it's wiki.

PrimeDAO's mission is:

Facilitate wide adoption of open finance by coordinating and cultivating projects that promote safety, reliability, liquidity, and open access, while avoiding centralized appropriation of critical financial infrastructure through decentralized governance.

PrimeDAO has four key goals:

1. Liquidity: In DeFi, liquidity must be efficiently utilized such that slippage and user experience are on par with centralized exchanges. Aggregation and layer-2 technologies available today provide powerful tools that realize economies of scale. PrimeDAO’s first product is a liquidity aggregator that provides best-price discovery, slippage reduction, and reliable settlement.
2. Safety: Smart contracts need to be less exploitable than centralized exchanges and must function as intended under all circumstances (e.g. network congestion, rapid market movements). Cross-project audits, increased integration testing, ecosystem bug bounties, and insurance mechanisms can improve overall safety and confidence. As one of its first products, PrimeDAO will prioritize creating a decentralized DeFi Safety Interface that informs and guides DeFi adopters.
3. Reliability: Price feed accuracy and transaction settlement success rates must be on par with those of centralized exchanges. When things go wrong, consensus decisions on remedies must swiftly be enacted so that mainstream users feel as secure as they would using a centralized exchange.
4. Governance: PrimeDAO will govern and allocate resources towards contributors for building, auditing, and maintaining its DeFi mechanisms and products. PrimeDAO aims to form a widely networked organization of interlinked DAOs, builder teams, and key individuals that efficiently coordinate systemic DeFi advancement, forming a sustainable home and neighborhood for DeFi builders and enthusiasts.

The compensation amount per contributor role in a raid is variable, because it is ultimately up to the Raid Leader's discretion how compensation is determined. Though, the commission process does require that clerics receive 500 $DAI as part of the consultation process, and that all members who participate in the Prepping for Battle phase receive three percent (3%) of the project budget as a commission. Lastly, how a contributor seeks to be compensated also depends on the contributor's choice of reward.

It appears that any SNX staker can vote in elections. Lastly, the councils rely on rely on a self-nomination process to populate candidates, l. For the Core Contributor Committee (CCC), the Core Contributors (CC)   rely on a self-nomination process to populate candidates, and  a ranked-choice voting mechanism to select candidates.

#### Reasoning
Uniswap's token (UNI) acts as a governance token over the Uniswap protocol, and as an economic token because UNI token holders can receive fees if UNI token holders decide to turn on the fee switch.

Synthetix's SNX token grants holders governance rights (the right to vote in elections and stand for nomination in elections) and economic rights (earn rewards from trading fees and inflationary rewards via staking).

### BSP-09: Does the DAO use a participatory governance model?


#### Answer
Partial

#### Points

Uniswap utilizes a referendum system (or a proposal-based system from direct democracy) were UNI token holders can submit proposals. However, a member must have "at least 2.5 million UNI delegated to your address in order to submit a proposal, or find someone who has enough UNI to meet the proposal threshold to propose on your behalf." Members of Uniswap can vote on proposals by self- or proxy-delegation. There does not appear to be a minimum UNI token holding requirement to vote on proposals.
