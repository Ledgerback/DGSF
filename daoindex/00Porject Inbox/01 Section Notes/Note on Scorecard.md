3. Does the DAO have managers from multiple geographic regions?
### Practicing DAO Cooperativism	

> Implementing a quasi-form of cooperativism for the web that enables democratized ownership or prioritizes membership (e.g., networked-membership)

1. Does the DAO have a collective treasury (or multisig account)?
	1. community ownership structure
2. Does the DAO have currencies recognizing value beyond financial relations, such as labor, contributor well-being, or environmental impact?
	1. incentive structures (economic, reputation, other social?)
	2. align with diversity of membership
3. Does the DAO have a collective membership mark to signify membership in the DAO?
	1. Not the same as membership criteria 
	2. badges
	3. social identification with DAOs
	4. digital artifacts to help establish organizational boundary 
	5. social mechanisms for screening to prevent issues like: scams and abuse 
		1. can think of it also like a student or employee ID card
4. Does the DAO redistribute profits/surplus on a basis other than capital holdings?
	1. incentives besides rent-seeking
	2. incentives for usage and participation? 
	3. more on this 
	4. contribution-based or need-based incentives 
	5. merit-based incentives 
	6. co-created value distribution > incentives
	7. example:
		1. [Dragon-kill Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points)
		2. [REI Member dividend](https://www.rei.com/blog/rei-news/member-reward)
5. Does the DAO have any accountability mechanisms that subject the power of leaders and managers to the members?
6. Does the DAO have an amendment procedure for its rules, procedures or policies?
7. Does the DAO have a decision-making matrix?
8. Does the DAO have metrics beyond governance and finance, such as contributor well-being or happiness?
9. Does the DAO have separate tokens for governance and economic rights?
10. Does the DAO not make governance tokens tradeable?
11. Does the DAO provide education and training opportunities for members to meaningful participate in governance?
### Cultural patterns and Brand	

> The promotion of an organizational identity

1. Does the DAO publish content on its activites in its' public channels?
2. Does the DAO make an explicit, clearly articulated statement of its purpose, values and norms?
### Information & Data Transparency

> Publicizing information and data (generally, information that should be public) related to governance, financials, products, and other areas to members and the general public in an easily understandable manner

1. Does the DAO provide an organizational analytics dashboard?
2. Does the DAO make its governance activities (e.g., proposals, decisions) publicly accessible at free to low-cost?

### DAO2DAO	

> DAOs engaging directly with other DAOs in business transactions or other transactions

1. Does the DAO have any planned transactions with another DAO?
2. Does the DAO have any current transactions with another DAO?
### Organizational Technology	

> The use of Web3 technologies for organizational matters (governance, finance, management, operations, etc.)

1. Does the DAO currently use any Web3 organizational technology for business-to-business operations?
2. Does the DAO currently use any Web3 organizational technology for treasury management?
3. Does the DAO currently use any Web3 organizational technology for contribution-tracking?
4. Does the DAO currently use any Web3 organizational technology for decision-making?
### Human-centered Algorithmic Governance

> The use of algorithmic (or automated) systems in governance should support human decision-making and humane practices, rather than replacing or removing humans from governance. In other words, preventing a DAO’s use of algorithmic decision-making to lead to the DAO becoming a panopticon or the downfall of the DAO.

1. Does the DAO explicitly acknowledge the possible vulnerabilities of algorithmic decision-making?
2. Does the DAO educate its members on the development and use of algorithms, as they pertain to the DAO?
3. Does the DAO explicitly consider the short- and long-term social consequences of the algorithmic systems in the development and use of algorithms?
