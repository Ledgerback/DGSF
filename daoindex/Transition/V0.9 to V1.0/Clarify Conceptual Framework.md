# Charles's Thoughts

## Goal
We conceptualize an Ideal DAO (ID), an idealistic vision (or version) of a DAO, and use the ID as a reference point or measuring stick for real-world DAOs.

Through the ID, we can bridge our (ideal) expectations for DAOs with the real-world practices of existing DAOs.

## Method 
We conceptualize the ID as a DAO that puts the DAO Index principles into practice. 

I think we could also use the Org Design (OD) dimensions as well, but I leave this one to Xule to further explain.
