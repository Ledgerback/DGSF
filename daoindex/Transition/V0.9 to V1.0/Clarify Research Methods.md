## Goal

Review academic and grey literature for identifying:

1. Good and bad (or preferred and not preferred) practices in and of DAOs
2. Potential organizing principles that we would expect an [[Clarify Conceptual Framework|Ideal DAO (ID)]] to put into practice
### Updated on 2024-05-01

Conduct a literature review of academic and grey lit. (unsure of specific method currently) to answer the following questions:

1. What principles can serve as guidance for good governance in DAOs?
	- how do they reflect general principles for good gov (from ISO standard) in organizations, and how do they expand upon them (in the digital context?)?
2. What constitutes DAO identity? 
	- Can we use DAO identity as a normative yardstick (i.e., benchmark)?
		- > This paper argues they can also serve a normative yardstick role in efforts to provide contextual social indicators for sustainability reporting that aims to instigate transformative change
	- what is the org design goal of DAOs? 
		- Is this the end goal of DAO identity?
	- can we describe DAO identity like Cooperative identity?
3. Can we develop an instrument to benchmark and compare DAOs?
	1. Should the instrument assess adherence to the principles? Or what should the instrument assess specifically?
	2. How can the instrument (or the results of the instrument) provide benefits to others?

## Method

I think a qualitative method, primarily focusing on thematic analysis (not sure if this is correct though), could suffice in identifying DAO practices and potential organizing principles. 

The principles would serve as our conceptual framework, from which we would create an instrument (here, a questionnaire) for assessing how DAOs are adhering to the principles.

We can then use quantitative methods to examine the instrument through case studies (i.e., assessments) of DAOs. 

So, all in all, a two-part methodology:

1. Qualitative method to develop conceptual framework
	1. Literature review (or thematic analysis?)
2. Quantitative method to test the instrument based on conceptual framework
	1. Testing
		1. internal consistency
		3. content validity
		4. construct validity
			1. factor analysis
		5. concurrent validity
		6. reliability
			2. inter-rater reliability

### Updated on 2024-05-01
Method probably will not change too much, but I think switching to a question-oriented approach will provide more clarity on why we are researching DAOs and developing the DAO Index.

### Flow
Literature Review -> Conceptual framework -> Instrument
