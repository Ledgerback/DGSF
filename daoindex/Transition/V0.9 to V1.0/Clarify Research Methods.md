# Charles's Thoughts

## Goal

Review academic and grey literature for identifying:

1. Good and bad (or preferred and not preferred) practices in and of DAOs
2. Potential organizing principles that DAOs should put into practice

## Method

I think a qualitative method, primarily focusing on thematic analysis (not sure if this is correct though), could suffice in identifying DAO practices and potential organizing principles. 

The principles would serve as our conceptual framework, from which we would create an instrument (here, a questionnaire) for assessing how DAOs are adhering to the principles.

We can then use quantitative methods to examine the instrument through case studies (i.e., assessments) of DAOs. 

So, all in all, a two-part methodology:

1. Qualitative method to develop conceptual framework
2. Quantitative method to test instrument based on conceptual framework
