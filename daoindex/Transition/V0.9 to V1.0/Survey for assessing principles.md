To ensure that the principles properly characterize DAOs, and can be used to describe an Ideal DAO (ID), we will send out a survey to DAO operators, DAO tooling providers, and DAO researchers (academic and otherwise), to get feedback on our principles.


Ideally, respondents will assess the principles on the following attributes:

%%need to think of more attributes here%%

2. Generic: is the principle germane to all DAOs?
3. Coherence: is the principle's description logical and consistent?
4. Detail: does the principle's description require further exposition?
5. Understanding: do you understand why the principle is generic to DAOs?
6. Overlap: Does this principle overlap with another principle?
7. Organizational differences: does the principle apply to DAOs irrespective of size, industry, mission, profit-making status?
8. Guidance: Can the principle provide useful guidance for DAO development?
9. Support: Does the rationale provide sufficient support for the principle's inclusion in the DAO Index?
10. Specificity: Is the principle too specific to a DAO's particular context (e.g., industry, size)?
11. Contextually: Can DAOs adhere to the principle through different structures?
12. Normative: Does the principle strengthen the social layer of DAOs?
12. Organizing model: Does the principle make DAOs, as a form of organizing, more coherent?
13. Ideal DAO: Can a DAO that puts the principles into practice serve as a reference point for other DAOs?




Probably best to have two optional comments fields: 

1. suggested changes, and 
2. general comments.

We can use the survey, in addition to our own assessments, to test the content validity of the instrument.

Now, how many people to share the survey with?

We probably only need [ten (10) respondents](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-many-experts-RUgauAP0RT.9UtVhBsH3YQ).

Information we need from respondents?

1. Name
2. Email address
3. How many years involved in DAOs?
4. The number of DAOs they have participated in
5. Ascertain if they conduct any research on DAOs
5. Ascertain if they build tools for DAOs
5. Ascertain if they conduct SciComm on DAOs or outreach of DAOs to the public

Possible respondents:

1. Morshed Mannan
2. Kelsie Nabben
3. Nathan Schneider
4. Clinamenic
5. dOrg member
6. ...
