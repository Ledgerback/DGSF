To ensure the content of our items is appropriate, I (Charles Adjovu) propose creating and issuing a survey to assess the content validity of our questionnaire. 

To assess content validity, we will send out a survey to DAO operators, DAO tooling providers, and DAO researchers (academic and otherwise), to get feedback on our questionnaire.

Ideally, respondents will assess the questionnaire on the following attributes:

![![daoindex/Transition/V0.9 to V1.0/#^Table]]
Probably best to have two optional comments fields: 

1. suggested changes, and 
2. general comments.

We can use the survey, in addition to our own assessments, to test the content validity of the instrument.

Now, how many people to share the survey with?

We probably only need [ten (10) respondents](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-many-experts-RUgauAP0RT.9UtVhBsH3YQ).

Information we need from respondents?

1. Name
2. Email address
3. How many years involved in DAOs?
4. The number of DAOs they have participated in
5. Ascertain if they conduct any research on DAOs
5. Ascertain if they build tools for DAOs
5. Ascertain if they conduct SciComm on DAOs or outreach of DAOs to the public

Possible respondents:

1. Morshed Mannan
2. Kelsie Nabben
3. Nathan Schneider
4. Clinamenic
5. ...
