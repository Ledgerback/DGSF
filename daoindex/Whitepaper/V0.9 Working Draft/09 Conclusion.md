**Introduction** (probably not needed)

**Problem Statement**

We introduced DAO alignment, the friction between real-world DAO practices and our vision of DAOs (through values-based expectations). We believe DAO alignment is influenced by Transparency Poverty, Lack of Measurable Expectations, Conceptual Opacity, Regression to the Code, and Weak Learning. 

**Our Response**

In response, we have developed the DAO Index, a set of principles, to identify how a DAO should be governed and operated, operationalized through a questionnaire, to assess adherence to the principles. The DAO Index addresses the issues influencing DAO Alignment, and provides many benefits beyond simply ratings to researchers, DAO operators, and society.

**Methods**

We collected literature to identify principles and criteria for evaluating DAOs.

We piloted the questionnaire by conducting assessments on eleven DAOs, to create our assessments dataset (responses, materials, etc.).

We conducted the following analyses on the draft assessments (refer to Analysis notebook; results of analysis notebook should be included in Findings section):

1. examined the correlation of responses (for question independence?)
2. created radar charts for each DAO based on their scores per principle
3. created a bar chart of each DAO's overall score
3. created a bar chart of each DAO's scores per principle
5. created a scores table for overall scores and scores per principle for all DAOs assessed
6. created a table counting the number of questions where no information could be found to answer the question
7. created a table counting the number of questions inapplicable to a DAO

We conducted the following analyses on the Questionnaire, as of Version 0.9:

1. conducted Chronbach's Alpha to determine internal consistency
2. conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the important factors[^1][^2]

We found that ...

**Discussion**

Though we believe our project has provided value to all stakeholders, it still suffered from the assumptions and limitations of our approach. In the future, we hope to improve our approach to better serve as a model or guiding light for how DAOs should be operated and governed, and for benchmarking and comparing DAOs.
