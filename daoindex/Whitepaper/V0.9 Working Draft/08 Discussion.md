# should just focus on limitations and future directions

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Notes
 3. DAO definition (or DAO conceptualization)
	1. Is there a need for a definition (or can we simply focus on practices (or can we define daos based on their practices rather than imaginary or conceptualizations)?
	   1. [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd/)
	   2. [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/)
	   3. <https://talentdao.substack.com/p/nodw-16-developing-the-dao-health>
	   4. [Location-based Platform Work Principles](https://fair.work/en/fw/principles/fairwork-principles-location-based-work/)

	   6. [Data Cooperatives for Pandemic Times - Public Seminar](https://publicseminar.org/essays/data-cooperatives-for-pandemic-times/)
		  1. “To avoid mission creep, data cooperatives need to adhere to the globally shared definition of what makes an organization a cooperative:”
	2. Definition should be broad enough to allow others to more narrowly define DAOs for their local contexts?
1. Outside-in view of assessment
	1. Reliance on publicly available information
2. Approach may be inadequate
3. Principles chosen may not be representative of ideals for how a DAO should be operated and governed
4. absence of standardized documentation (like SEC's K-10)
5. absence of measurements of crucial metrics (at least publicly)
6. small dataset
7. lack of systematic research approach to developing principles and questionnaire
8. scoring method may be inadequate because ... 

## Future Directions

### Notes
1. Research Questions
2. Designing Principles
	1. developing a more systematic method for collecting and analyzing literature to find and select principles (same for questions)
3. Scoring Methods
	1. developing a more systematic method for scoring responses to the questionnaire
	2. experimenting with more scoring methods for the questionnaire
4. Instrument Analysis
5. Knowledge Delivery
	1. Improve Web UI
