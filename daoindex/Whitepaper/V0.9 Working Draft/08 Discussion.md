### Notes
1. Research Questions
2. Designing Principles
	1. developing a more systematic method for collecting and analyzing literature to find and select principles (same for questions)
3. Scoring Methods
	1. developing a more systematic method for scoring responses to the questionnaire
	2. experimenting with more scoring methods for the questionnaire
4. Instrument Analysis
5. Knowledge Delivery
	1. Improve Web UI
6. [cognitive interviews](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1272902.pdf)
	1. have more interviews with others to see if they can understand the questions

## Assumptions and Limitations
Our current work on the DAO Index, Version 0.9, faced the following assumptions and limitations:

1. An explicit assumption and limitation of our approach is our DAO definition.[^2] Our DAO definition inherently excludes organizations, that may be considered DAOs by others. Though, we hope to counter this issue by focusing on the principles.
2. The assessment takes an outside-in approach to assessing DAOs. Thus, we do not have complete information about the internal workings of the DAO, but only the publicly available information we can find provided by the DAO directly, or indirectly through third parties.
3. The principles we selected may not be representative of ideals for how a DAO should be operated and governed. In other words, our principles may not reflect the views of members of the DAO ecosystem, the public, and academia.
4. Our assessments were limited by the lack of standardized documentation, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s standard for Form K-10. The lack of standardized documentation limited our efforts to identify potential sources for responses.
5. Our dataset of eleven assessments is a small dataset, that makes it difficult to truly generalize the results of our assessments. 
6. Our methodology suffered from a lack of systematic research approach to developing the principles and questionnaire, which may have led to compromised results or the inability to interpret our results to determine reasonable outcomes.
7. Our scoring method may be inadequate for benchmarking and comparing DAOs%%need more prose here%%.

## Future Directions

Here, future work on the project will include:

1. Conducting inter-rater reliability checks
3. Developing a more scientifically-grounded/robust methodology for identifying and selecting the principles and questions for the questionnaire, and for scoring assessments
3. Developing a more scientifically-grounded/robust methodology  for scoring assessments
4. Improving our dashboard's UI/UX to make it easier to identify relevant resources and better use the ratings
6. ~~Conducting test re-test reliability checks~~
