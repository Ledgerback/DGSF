## Empirical Challenge(s)

1. Transparency poverty
   1. [Web3 Work research report: The DAO contributor's perspective](https://otherinternet.substack.com/p/web3-work-research-report)
      1. “Transparent work processes vs. transparent technologies. Another issue that contributes to burnout and exhaustion is the lack of transparency when it comes to work processes, and the information asymmetries between contributors and former core teams. These issues cannot be addressed solely by transparent technology.”
   2. [Social Security for Web3 Work: A Preliminary Specification of the Design and Deployment of Solidarity Primitives for DAO Contributors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4596552)
      1. “While extensive information resides on-chain and within forums, there appears to be a lack of willingness to transparently discuss challenges and phase-shifts among DAOs and web3 organizations. This paradox of transparency particularly applies to discussions of failure and loss, perhaps in view of the prevailing focus on success that characterizes the space. Building a culture of honesty based on the open sourcing of information and processes are vital components of a thriving open ecosystem – particularly for non-technical roles and fields (i.e. design, facilitation, org research and internal practices).”

      1. “There is a steep rise in the number of perceived DAOs over time, as shown in Fig. 1. This number is disputable, as DAOs are ambiguously defined [14,15]. Ambiguous DAO definitions may lead to some confusion over whether a certain organization is a DAO or not. Clarity in the DAO definition is important for both users and researchers. For users, what defines a DAO can have consequences on their decision if they would like to participate in such an organization, whereas for researchers, conceptual clarity is key for understanding and analyzing an empirical situation.”
      2. “As DAOs are multifaceted, various definitions approach DAOs from different perspectives, ranging from functional, organizational form, and purpose perspectives to technical creation, setup, and scientific and practical perspectives. There is no clear consensus about what makes up a DAO in the literature [14], which can be attributed to its emerging nature. In the next subsection, we discuss the similarities and differences in the definitions and characteristics of DAOs by summarizing and developing the functional and technological perspectives of DAOs. We then analyze the extracted and observed characteristics to identify the most common characteristics in the existing definitions. We create a comprehensive definition by combining these common characteristics with the observed characteristics in our empirical research.”

or say that there is misalignment of what DAOs ought to be, and what they are, and that here are examples or the effects of this misalignment (transparency poverty, etc.), and through solution, we can push DAOs towards re-aligning with ideal or imaginary.

DAOs, as currently constructed

DAOs, as currently conceptualized, are facing

We term this problem, the *DAO Alignment problem*. 

# Outline

1. define root of misalignment
2. particular problem clusters
	1. transparency poverty
# Prose



## Defining the root of misalignment  (or just misalignment) problem (or misalignment with values) (or just say problem is how to rate and compare DAOs (design and governance)?)
There is a misalignment of what DAOs ought to be, and how DAOs operate in practice.[^20] 

This misalignment, between the expectations, dervied from the web3 ethos, and the current practices of DAOs, is

Web3 ethos includes ...

This separation or discrepancy between the expectations and current reality of DAOs, is the main cause or is at the root of additional problems that plague DAOs.[^1] [^20] 

This separation or discrepancy between the expectations based on web3 ethos and the current reality of DAOs, is the main cause or is at the root of additional problems that plague DAOs.[^1] [^20] 

This separation or discrepancy between the expectations based on our vision (or definition or intended design goals of DAOs or values derived from the web3 ethos, cooperative values, cypherpunk values, and many other influences) of DAOs[^35][^36][^37][^38] [^39] and the current reality of DAOs, is the main cause or is at the root of additional problems that plague DAOs.[^1] [^20] 







We term this problem the *DAO Alignment problem*. 

> DAO Alignment Problem: The goal of aligning DAO practices with DAO expecations (or values-based expectations)


> DAO Alignment Problem: The goal of aligning real-world DAO practices with our vision of DAOs (through values-based expectations)

> DAO Alignment Problem: The friction between real-world DAO practices and our vision of DAOs (through values-based expectations)


The DAO alignment problem is the root of these additional problems plaguing DAOs (or real-world issues plaguing DAOs or issues plaguing DAOs, stemming from alignment problem) or is caused by the following issues:

2. DAO-washing (or using DAO acronym to sell product or fundraising, rather than to grow org, or to use DAO tooling, without wanting to run an org)
3. lack of DAO benchmarks (or measurable expectations)
4. limitations of solely relying on quantitative measures 
	1. or just measuring what is easy to measure
5. Values Drift
	1. maybe mention [tyranny of openness](https://podcast.sustainoss.org/45)?
6. DAO incidents
	7. https://www.ournetwork.xyz/p/our-network-deep-dive-2
7. token-based voting (or coin voting)
	1. ask Xule if this should be added
8. not employing Signal strategy for privacy messengers
9. regression to conventional ownership or start-up structure, rather than experimenting with alternative ownership
10. **Insufficient Tools for Transparency**: There is a noticeable lack of comprehensive tools capable of providing clear, transparent operations within DAOs. This void hinders both the internal efficiency of DAOs and the public's ability to fully comprehend their mechanisms.
    
2. **Lack of Comprehensive DAO Practices Repository** (i.e., weak learning from TIAL): The DAO ecosystem is currently missing a centralized, well-curated repository that documents the spectrum of practices — both exemplary and suboptimal — within various DAOs. Such a resource is essential for learning, adaptation, and the avoidance of past pitfalls.
    
3. **Conceptual Misunderstandings**: Across various sectors, including academia, industry, and society at large, there exists a significant gap in the fundamental understanding of what DAOs are and how they function. This lack of understanding stifles informed discussion, research, and development in the field.
    
4. **The Imaginary-Reality Gap**: There is a stark contrast between the idealized vision of what DAOs promise to be and what they are in practice. This gap between theory and reality — the "imaginary-reality gap" — leads to misconceptions about the capabilities and limitations of DAOs, affecting stakeholder expectations and trust.

We belive these issues stem from the expectations of DAOs OD, including more equitable forms of ownership and democratic forms of governance.

- somewhat doing that by mentioning OD goal in earleir section, and then describing some of the issues (we believe) lead to misalignment
## Transparency poverty (any need to elaborate on the problems?)

> **Insufficient Tools for Transparency**: There is a noticeable lack of comprehensive tools capable of providing clear, transparent operations within DAOs. This void hinders both the internal efficiency of DAOs and the public's ability to fully comprehend their mechanisms.

sub-issue:

1. blockchains do not provide all information
1. lack of tooling

### blockchains do not provide all information
Even though blockchain and other Web3 tech provides transparent data regarding organizational activities, stored on-chain, this data only covers activities that are recorded on-chain.[^1] [^2] This misses the critical orgniazational activities that occur off-chain.[^1] [^2]  Though, it is easier to measure on-chain activity[^4] , this misses out on crucial data on DAOs, such as work practices and discussions, thus preventing a holistic view %%or analysis%% of DAOs and how they operate in the real world.[^1] [^2] [^3] [^20][^41] Additionally, as mentioned in *[Web3 Work research report: The DAO contributor's perspective](https://otherinternet.substack.com/p/web3-work-research-report)*, this can lead to information asymmetries developing between different DAO stakeholder groups.[^2]

> [T]he lack of transparency when it comes to work processes, and the information asymmetries between contributors and former core teams. These issues cannot be addressed solely by transparent technology.

~~In general, much of a DAO's activities are conducted off-chain, which is not transparent.[^1] [^2]~~

Even then, a transpaernt governance system is nto enough to prevent capture (or principle-agent problems).[^9]

> The governance of the protocol resembled an oligarchy before a democracy. Suggestions we made that aligned with the interests of holders of large amounts of governance tokens (namely VC firms) were taken in stride. As soon as this order was questioned though, our intent was seen as adversarial.

Most DAOs today still do not provide data or information on the inner politics (e.g., voting blocs mentioned on DeepDAO) or stakeholder relationships of their members.[^9] Generally, most DAO-related documentation is woefully lacking, inhibiting a holistic understanding of a DAO.[^40]
## Weak Learning (may move under transparency poverty)
> **Lack of Comprehensive DAO Practices Repository** (i.e., weak learning from TIAL): The DAO ecosystem is currently missing a centralized, well-curated repository that documents the spectrum of practices — both exemplary and suboptimal — within various DAOs. Such a resource is essential for learning, adaptation, and the avoidance of past pitfalls.

This misalignment also leads to the DAO ecosystem having a slow learning rate, as evidenced by a lack of Comprehensive DAO Practices Repositories. 

Other than The Collective Governance Archives by Optimism Foundation[^12], CommunityRule[^11], and Govbase by the Metagov project, there are few, if any, large, well-curated repositories documenting DAO practices (though, not limited to solely DAOs). Even fewer that includes DAO failures

As mentioned in *[Social Security for Web3 Work: A Preliminary Specification of the Design and Deployment of Solidarity Primitives for DAO Contributors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4596552)*, the DAO ecosystem is reluctant to discuss challenges and failures of DAOs, possibly because of the use of DAOs as a marketing tool or means to avoid securities regulators.[^5] As mentioned earlier, the issue of transparency poverty also plays into this issue.

The ever-ending focus on DAO successes, rather than on incidents, inhibits the design space, makes it harder for DAOs to meet expectations for DAOs, hurts DAO operators because of a lack of case studies to learn from to develop their own DAOs, and harms DAO understanding from the public and regulators.

> “While extensive information resides on-chain and within forums, there appears to be a lack of willingness to transparently discuss challenges and phase-shifts among DAOs and web3 organizations. This paradox of transparency particularly applies to discussions of failure and loss, perhaps in view of the prevailing focus on success that characterizes the space. Building a culture of honesty based on the open sourcing of information and processes are vital components of a thriving open ecosystem – particularly for non-technical roles and fields (i.e. design, facilitation, org research and internal practices).”

Also, an over-reliance on quantiative measures, such as the number of tokenholders or proposal activity, though easy to measure, may be red-herrings because of issues with address clustering (e.g., determining unique token holders).[^10] 

### repeated incidents

The inability to learn from past incidents, minor, major, or something in-between, inhibits DAO practices from learning not to repeat similar incidents.

Something akin to Rekt.news, specifically for DAO incidents, could be helpful to address this weak learning aspect of the DAO ecossytem.



**can also mention repeated DAO incidents that continue to happen, even though well known in idnutry or just happen too often**

*Can turn this into a table*
For example, many DAOs have suffered from hostile governance takeovers in the past few years from outsiders buying up governance tokens to raid the DAO's treasury.[^22] 

An additional issue is starting DAOs without a clear mission.[^25]


## DAO-washing 

Akin to greenwashing, decentralization-washing or community-washing[^6], DAO-washing is the use of the term DAO by an organization, most notably, a Web3 startup, to claim that it is a DAO to raise funds from investors and to appeal to Web3-interested individual or potential users, without making a forthright effort to operate the organization as a DAO.[^7] [^15] [^16] 



%%**need to look for DAOs that claim to be decentralized but are really centralized**%%

**


    



**

As mentioned by Bryan Lherer in *What Happened to the New Internet?*, Uniswap showed such two-facedness, in the use of Other Internet to somewhat show the acceptance of their governance model for Uniswap DAO, though it onyl favored one stakeholder grup, the investors .[^9] This two-facedness, one of decentralization and community in public, and of centralization and solely investor interest in private, is epidemic in DAOs and the Web3 ecosystem (solely blockchain) in general (need a cite).

> It didn't take long for doubt to begin to seep into our initial aspirations for the project. Upon diving deep into the working reality of the protocol our suspicions around potential for reform were revealed to be warranted. The governance of the protocol resembled an oligarchy before a democracy. Suggestions we made that aligned with the interests of holders of large amounts of governance tokens (namely VC firms) were taken in stride. As soon as this order was questioned though, our intent was seen as adversarial. Maybe more unsettling was that it seemed like most people just didn't really care about what we were doing, not even out of disinterest but out of apathy. This supported the hypothesis that 'governance' in the context of a cryptocurrency trading protocol was something of a [misnomer](https://otherinter.net/research/uniswap-governance-findings/). There wasn't actually a whole lot to govern, nor an engaged constituency of voters. The notion of using our influence to precipitate wealth redistribution was almost immediately thrown out the window.

> Similar to my experience at the geospatial startup, it felt like there was an inescapable two-facedness amongst the peers we would deal with working in and around crypto. Publicly, individuals and firms projected careful messages that defended crypto as a bastion of the New Internet and financial freedom. In private conversations though, there was a frank embrace of the medium as nothing more than a game of wealth accumulation with underlying systems of governance that were intractably broken. Like a lot of software work, there was very little detailed discussion about the philosophy behind why we were doing the things we were doing. The catch-all banner of 'decentralization' was justification enough. Over time, this motivating force grew tenuous and the more that it became clear that decentralization wasn't any tangible goal, the more we wondered if we were in fact the bad guys, or at the very least, being employed by them.



This issue is further complicated by the lack of conceptual clarity regarding DAOs as a concept, as described in the *Lack of Conceputal Clarity* section.

%%Could tech-driven solutionism fall under here?%%

## Lack of Measurable Expectations (or measurable norms or self-regulation)

Though there is a claim that DAOs practice decentralized governance and/or operations, it is hard to find or see in reality.[^4] 

A lack of measurable expecations for DAO organizing practices (or OD) inhibits the ability for:

1. the DAO ecosystem to learn from past incidents,
2. detemrining when an organization is organziing or aligning itself with the DAO cocnept,

This can also lead to value drift, because a lack of a meta-normative logic[^8] to align OD inherently leads to any organization claiming to be a DAO, without necessarily for purposes that help Web3?

As mentioned by Bryan Lherer in *What Happened to the New Internet?*, the lack of measurable expecations for how Uniswap DAO should have organized made it overly difficult to advise Uniswap to engage in acts that may have gone against ivnestor interest, but supported the interests of other stakeholder groups.[^9]

As mentioned in *[How Plutocracy Undermines the DAO | HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/how-plutocracy-undermines-the-dao)*, there is a "need to move toward some institutionalized principles that can be considered the 'best.' Or at least the most 'right' ones."[^17]

As menionted by  Jacqueline Radebaugh in *[Cooperatives: the fulfilment of big tech’s empty promises - jason wiener | p.c.](https://jrwiener.com/cooperatives-the-fulfilment-of-big-techs-empty-promises/)*, without a set of measurable expecations or organizing principles, "Web3 will be overtaken by those investors missing the mark on what the Web3 ethos of shared ownership and decentralization."[^18]

> “I see both DAO projects that reflect a stakeholder ownership model, and also a number of projects that are heavily financed by outside, profit-driven investors. I am concerned that without the adoption of a clear set of principles, like the cooperative movements have done with the Rochdale principles and the Mondragon principles, Web3 will be overtaken by those investors missing the mark on what the Web3 ethos of shared ownership and decentralization. Shared ownership models offer a promising alternative to traditional business models that prioritize profits over social welfare. Web3 technologies and platform cooperatives can help to overcome the hurdles that these models face, and create a more equitable and sustainable economy that benefits everyone. We must work together to promote and support these models, and ensure that our economy is serving the needs of all people.”
   
The lack of measurable expecations (or is this weak learning?) also inhibits learing from past mistakes and failures on how to use blockchain and other Web3 tech to support governance and operations.[^20] As mentioned in *[Scaling Trust in DAOs: Trustware vs Socialware](https://orca.mirror.xyz/T70CmuhX95ubkw_JHOxSEy8d_EFeYXgtJnF13mPtaZE)*, we expect DAOs to optimize (what is being optimized here?) or augment more of their governance and operations through Web3 tech, but this unlikely to be done at a reasonable pace, and with less damage to the ecosystem, without measurable expectations on how DAOs should operate.[^20] [^21]

> Over time, we expect DAOs to transition elements of socialware into trustware and expand the code-at-the-center of their organization, but this will take time, technological advancements, trial and error, and continued mistakes and iterations.

And even when empirical data is presented to show issues inthe DAO ecosystem, very rarely does any signifcant change occur in DAO practices.[^23] Without any measureable expecations or standards of organizing practices, backed by empirical data, there is little reason for DAO practices to systemtically change at an ecosystem level.[^50]

This lack of measurable expectations may also be a reason why DAOs generally default to conventional ownership strcutures (though, this could also be for funding), rather than experimetning with altenrative ownership structures.

Though DAOs generally espouse democratic governance and collective ownership, in reality, most DAOs in reality are plutocratic.[^1][^9] Most DAOs, in reality, default to conventional ownership structures, where ownership is highly concentrated, and generally using 1 token 1 vote method for voting power, which further entrenches whales in governance or conforms the goals fo the organization with whales, rather than the whole membership or with other stakeholdrs or which leads to failing to include small token-holders.[^1][^9] This default to conventional ownership inhibits expeirmetnation with alternative ownership structures that stress stakeholder accountability and values alignment. The lack of measurable expectations on ownership structures is also one of the reasons for misalignment.



Value drift can fall here.

## Lack of Conceptual Clarity


As mentioned in [The ins and outs of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) unraveling the definitions, characteristics, and emerging developments of DAOs - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720923000180)[^10], there are nearly countless number of DAO definitions, stemming from the author's own discipline or perspective, leading to a lack of consensus in the acacdemic literature and industry on how to define DAOs.[^10]

As mentioned by the authors, "[c]larity in the DAO definition is important for both users and researchers. For users, what defines a DAO can have consequences on their decision if they would like to participate in such an organization, whereas for researchers, conceptual clarity is key for understanding and analyzing an empirical situation.”[^10]

The lack of conceptual clarity inhibits alignment with the DAO concept because then the set of measureable expecations or values-based expectations will constantly change as definitions change. Thus, preventing a standard means for comparing DAOs.[^10]

Even the definition mentioned in [The ins and outs of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) unraveling the definitions, characteristics, and emerging developments of DAOs - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096720923000180)[^10], "A DAO is a system in which storage and transaction of value and notary (voting) functions can be designed, organized, recorded, and archived, and where data and actions are recorded and autonomously executed in a decentralized way,” may be too strict, overly limiting the kinds of organizations that can be considered DAOs, such as those who do not automate execution of proposals solely via smart contracts (this can lead to issues regarding incomplete contracts and the oracle problem, and pretty much any judgment that is subjective), even if they have more equitable forms of ownership and democratic forms of governance than DAOs that do so (e.g., DAOs that use Tally).[^10]

Thus, we may need new routes to clarify the concept, such as focusing on member perspectives[^14] or on organizational design[^26].

An additional issue with most definitions are that they are too binary, rather than focused on a spectrum[^20] (like decentralization).[^13]

The concept of decentralization also suffers from a lack of clarity, which can further complicate an understanding of DAOs.[^13]

## Code is not the only law: the need for a stronger social/normative layer (keep this issue?)

An additional issue that plagues DAOs is the *code is law* paradigm or way of thinking.[^24] As Lawrence Lessig mentions, "Yes, code is law. It's just not the only law."[^24] Simply because the software allows for it, does not mean such an act is socially accepted (or accepted by the DAO and external communities and parties).[^24] [^8] 

#### SAO/DAO (remove)
As mentioned in the SAO of the DAO, the authors mention how DAOs also need to consider the social infrastrucutre that plays a role in organizations, and to not try to complete erase it, because at the end of the day, DAOs are organization made up of people, supplmeneted by machines.[^27]

> Key Lessons: Both Bruce and Matt illuminated the significant role of human elements and social systems in DAO governance. While technology can assist, it cannot replace the need for real-world trust mechanisms and social frameworks. They cautioned against leaning too much on technology for governance, advocating for a balanced approach that includes social considerations]

#### Incomplete contracts (oracle problem as well) require social infrastructure (keep or remove?)

**maybe remove because it feels almost duplicative of regression to the code section**

An additional concern is that DAOs (and any institution that relies on Web3 technologies) will have to resolve situations involving incomplete contracts. 

Incomplete contracts are ...

In contrast, complete contracts are ...

For DAOs, that inherently deal with off-chain matters arising from aliging indivduals to work towards the DAO's mission, these situations are exteremly likely to arise and cannot be resolved by solely relying on smart contracts and software architecture to resolve social challenges.

For example, how can an

Basically, you cannot solely rely on smart contracts and software architecture to resolve social challenges. 

As Jesse Walden mentioned in , incomplete contracts are ""[^30]

```markdown
#### Complete Contracts

- Are "trust-minimized" (have little need for human intervention)
- Are difficult to change
- Are resistant to meddling
- Achieve scalability through verifiable, deterministic processes

**Examples**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Uniswap. automated arbitrage smart contracts

#### Incomplete contracts:

- Do not specify what is to be done in every possible eventuality
- Are open to ongoing interpretation
- Require human input (governance)
- Require alternative solutions for scalability

Having to deal with incomplete contracts leads to the next issue, regression to the code, as DAOs will often resort to the code for resolutions that smart contracts cannot inhernetly solve. Rather, DAOs should focus on developing robust social infrastructure for dealing with incomplete contracts.[^20]
#### Regression to the Code
The authors in *Crypto's Three Body Problem*[^8] elaborate more on this issue, mentioning that crypto suffers from regulatory isntability from a lack of "he software architecture, markets, and norms in the absence of law"

Also, that crypto is regulated by three primary bodies:

The authors in *Crypto's Three Body Problem*[^8] elaborate more on this issue, mentioning how this "[r]egression to the code erodes social norms, and this consequence accounts in large part for what repulses people from crypto."

Additionally, the authors mention that regression to the code does not always lead to legimitate outcomes

This issue, as mentioend by the authors, comes from the  the notion of credible neutrality, that as long as the protocol or software arhictecture allows the action to occur, that the action is legimiate. The authors obviosuly mention how this "doesn’t always produce legitimate outcomes, so it can’t be true all the time."[^8]

Lastly, the authors raise the important part that seeking credible neutrality at the protocol level or as a technical property of a protocol, does not prohibit that seeking "facilities that prevent user harm. Invoking credible neutrality should not have the primary effect of degrading accountability and putting users at risk. To make an analogy, one can endorse net neutrality, that is, non-discriminatory packet transport, without going so far as to foist dark UX patterns onto users. The question then is where and how is this regulatory force to be applied? Any such instruments of consumer protection must ultimately be self-regulated by protocol actors (interfaces, relayers, solvers) that remain answerable to users."

Lastly, the authors mention how regression to the code is a limiter on insitutal deisng for DAOs, especilly for promting social interactions.[^8]

> The question is not how to add norms or social agendas to the crypto “space,” but how to join crypto with a broader institutional ecology. When we imagine a crypto that is more integrated into social life, we don’t think of an uncorrelated economy accessed through screens, but of non-extractive media of exchange and real value production that are more seamlessly integrated with our daily institutions, supportive of the interactions, organizations, and social lives we already live. These sorts of institutions simply cannot be grown if regression to the code is the only binding rule.

Lastly, the authors mention, simialrly to the authors of the SAO of DAO, that "_technical protocols do not provide the answer alone, but act as the basis for wider social protocols._"

Furthermore, the authors mention that "as a protocol transitions to greater community-operation [...] the social challenges also become more demanding.", contentious matters cannot be resolved soelly through "programmed financial incentives but requires an added layer of discretionary logic tied to the values that a community upholds."[^8]

software (also refer to incomplete contracts), 

> Protocols include a variety of enshrined architectural features to facilitate coordination. Likewise, the creation of digital property rights with programmable controls has enabled an array of permissionless markets. However, as a protocol transitions to greater community-operation and takes on more complex administrative functions, the social challenges also become more demanding. In such cases contention cannot be addressed solely through programmed financial incentives but requires an added layer of discretionary logic tied to the values that a community upholds. In short, when conflicts among the three forces inevitably arise, they cannot be resolved through traditional, legal means.


This regression to the code appears to be "the foundational policy of the crypto space", but it is usually only enforced against small actors.[^8]

The authors stipulate that this issue arises from the notion of credible neutrality, 

lack of norms leads to ...

> Some view this regression phenomenon as the foundational policy of the crypto space: “whatever is permitted by the protocol’s code and market structure is legitimate.” This viewpoint, while rarely expressed in such direct terms, is remarkably common among crypto users. It is certainly present in the Curve case. It is also what is voiced when one defends the rights of hackers to exploit poorly designed protocols. As the hacker of Mango Markets [infamously stated](https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160), his team merely “operated a highly profitable trading strategy.”

> However, regression to the code doesn’t always produce legitimate outcomes, so it can’t be true all the time. In the cases explored earlier, the legitimacy of protocol adjudication is precisely what is in question. It is not clear, for example, that the inability to protect artist royalties is a good outcome. Many viewed it instead as an architectural shortcoming, taken advantage of by unscrupulous traders who skirted designers’ good intentions.

> Regression to the code erodes social norms, and this consequence accounts in large part for what repulses people from crypto. Even as protocols fulfill important social functions like affordable remittances and escape from inflationary regimes, “the space” appears to outsiders as greedy and riddled with scams. It is for this reason that crypto seems to stand apart from all prior human institutions. More than just “lawless,” it comes off as a “normless” zone where morality is suspended, even if the prevailing intention is to support the resiliency of all manner of social organizations.

> So the pervasive belief that anything permitted by the protocol is unquestionably legitimate is obviously harmful. But the true culprit behind this poisonous idea is the principle of credible neutrality. According to the doctrine of credible neutrality, the unbiased nature of a protocol implies the validity of all actions that take place under its purview. This includes not just contentious governance outcomes, but social violations such as hacks or scams that are technically permissible and yet tolerated in the name of neutrality and permissionless access.

> This is not to say censorship resistance should not be upheld as a fundamental technical property. However, there needs to be room somewhere for facilities that prevent user harm. Invoking credible neutrality should not have the primary effect of degrading accountability and putting users at risk. To make an analogy, one can endorse net neutrality, that is, non-discriminatory packet transport, without going so far as to foist dark UX patterns onto users. The question then is where and how is this regulatory force to be applied? Any such instruments of consumer protection must ultimately be self-regulated by protocol actors (interfaces, relayers, solvers) that remain answerable to users.

> Even within the stifling discourse of credible neutrality, there is a desire among some protocol designers and users to make norms a larger part of crypto’s self-regulatory function. In response to the paucity of effective normative regulation, a small cadre of self-regulating parties have stepped up to promote different forms of social welfare. Two institutions in particular have managed to get social buy-in by activating cross-cutting values shared by many in the Ethereum ecosystem: the public goods project Protocol Guild and the vigilante investigator ZachXBT.



### Open is not enough? (probably remove)
1. maybe mention [tyranny of openness](https://podcast.sustainoss.org/45)?

## regression to conventional ownership or start-up structure 

**probably falls nuder lack of measurable expectations**

Lack of experimentation and regression to traditional model stifles DAO develompent

Lack of measurabel expectations leads to organizations trying to become DAOs defaulting to conventional ownership or strart-up structure, which, for the most part, does not conform to the goals of DAOs.

### Plutocratic governance

Though DAOs espouse democratic governance and collective ownership, in reality, most DAOs in reality are plutocratic.[^1][^9] Most DAOs, in reality, default to conventional ownership structures, where ownership is highly concentrated, and generally using 1 token 1 vote method for voting power, which further entrenches whales in governance or conforms the goals fo the organization with whales, rather than the whole membership or with other stakeholdrs or which leads to failing to include small token-holders.[^1][^9] This default to conventional ownership inhibits expeirmetnation with alternative ownership structures that stress stakeholder accountability and values aignment.[^1]

The use of conventional ownership structures does not promote or implement practices that lead to less hierarchy and the disavows the use of collective governance mechanisms. (need a cite)

## not following Signal's strategy of viable alternative (probably do not need this subsection) (an issue, but not a cause of misalignment really)

- refer to https://signal.org/blog/signal-is-expensive/ 

## Subjectivity of algorithmic policy (or Lack of recognizing complexity and subjectivity of algorithmic policy) (probably do not need because this is not necessarily a cause of misalignment, but it is improtant for principles as proactive means to balance social and algorithmic governance)

## Blockchain tech does not guarantee correcting structural power imbalances in organizations (and ecosystems)

outline:

1. what is algorithmic governnace?
2. when do DAOs engage in algorithmic governance?
3. what are issues currently faced by DAOs from algorithm use? 
	1. or is this just the danger of DAOs becoming panopticons? (**mostly this one**)

Algorithmic policy, or how algorithms are developed and deployed, is an inherently subjective endeavor.[^31] Algorithm

Algorithms and data are non-objective

Algorithms act as a governance tool when they are used to control human interactions

> The problem with performing governance functions through algorithms in society is that defining the goals of algorithmic sequences of instructions is a [subjective practice](https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/techno-reflexivity-cf1331278bdc). If markets are the invisible hand of capitalism, then algorithms are the invisible hand of digital systems.[^31]

Given the complexity of developing a reputation or rewards system, it is imperative for DAOs to monitor and iterate upon their algorithmic policies to ensure that they remain accountable to their members.[^33]

Or, For example, building "[n]on-transferable reputation systems ... can be difficult to implement due to the complexity of measuring and validating reputation."[^33]

Michael Zrgham provides a good example of how subjectivity can affect the outcomes of an algorithm in *Exploring Subjectivity in Algorithms*.[^34]


DAOs engage in algorithmic governance when ....

An additional concern is that DAOs could become panotipcons.[^32] 

An important concern is that DAOs could become panotipcons.[^32] 


As also mentioned by ..., how a DAO determines their reputation and reward mechanisms is also subjcetive, and needs to be reviewed to ensure it meets the organization's objectives.

Can refer to crypto three-body problem, incomplete contracts and lawrence lessig, Kelsie Nabben on algorithmic policy  and DAO as panopticon, SAO of the DAO, oracle problem.
