## Introduce Project
The Distributed Governance Score Framework (DGSF) project is developing an open and participatory framework to re-define how organizations assess their alignment with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). At the heart of the DGSF project lies our tool, the DAO Index. 

The key features of the DAO Index include:

- **Standardized Principles**: Offering a unified %%@charles: should this be a *common set* instead?%% set of principles and language, DGSF enables clear measurement and reporting of an organization's alignment with DAO models.
- **Questionnaire**: As a practical application of DGSF, the DAO Index operationalizes these principles into a user-friendly tool, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world implementation of decentralized governance.

## relation to other sections

As part of the DGSF project, we are focused on addressing the problem of DAO alignment, *the friction between real-world DAO practices and our vision of DAOs*, further described in the [[04 Problem Statement|Problem Statement]] section.

To address DAO alignment issues, we are developing the aforementioned DAO Index, which is further described in the [[05 Our Response_DAO Index|Our Response]] section. 

As part of our development of the DAO Index, and more specifically, the DAO Index Version 0.9, we utilized the DAO Index questionnaire to assess eleven DAOs (including Gitcoin, Synthetix, and others) to determine their adherence to the DAO Index principles, and to obtain feedback from assessors (or our own experiences), members of DAOs we assessed, and third parties, on the DAO Index to incorporate into our design process and update the DAO Index accordingly.

This whitepaper details our current mental model for the DAO Index, our findings from assessing eleven DAOs with the questionnaire, and future plans for the DAO Index.

Through our initial work, we hope to shed light on current DAO practices and pain points (for DAO operators, academic and independent researchers, and the public) (or for industry, academia, and society), and invite others to learn and build upon our work.

## Background
### DAO Definition
For the purposes of our work, we define Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) as ==less-hierarchical== %%maybe go with heterarchical?%% communities of stakeholders who collectively govern and coordinate through a combination of algorithmic [^1] ==(citation?)== and social governance mechanisms [^2].   

%%alternatively, organizations driven by an ideology of self-governance through technological infrastructure%%

Stakeholders voluntarily [^3] contribute to shared resources and agree on a set of rules governing these resources to pursue common goals. They collectively define, divide, and allocate tasks and rewards to pursue effective integration of effort [^4].

DAOs are characterized by more equitable forms of ownership [^5] for diverse stakeholder groups, which allow stakeholders to share governance rights to access information and control shared resources.

<!-- DAOs are characterized by distributed ownership, which enables diverse stakeholder groups to share governance rights to ==access, control, and ownership of shared resources==. --> 

<!-- DAOs are characterized by more equitable forms of ownership, which enables diverse stakeholder groups to share governance rights to ==access, control, and ownership of shared resources==. --> 

[^1]: How we see algorithmic rules... (add more) only applicable to on-chain assets and does not require human interpretation. 

[^2]: design choice for DAOs to address practical concerns such as costs. 

[^3]: Participants may or may not be bound by formal contracts because... Also, membership is flexible. 

[^4]: The efficiency depends on the goals of the DAOs. 

[^5]: Different ownership structures are possible. concentration of ownership is a spectrum. 

Our whitepaper is not focused on inquiring on how to define DAOs (though, this is mentioned in the [[04 Problem Statement|problem statement]]), but on how to determine principles for how DAOs should be governed and operated.

### DAO OD Goal

We define the Organizational Design (OD) goal of DAOs as:

1. find (or experiment) and implement values and principles that develop, sustain, and scale DAOs, %%through a variety of organizational structures%%, to a large and diverse group of participants.
2. provide meta-narrative logic[^1] (values and principles) to develop, sustain, and scale DAOs, %%through a variety of organizational structures%%, to a large and diverse group of participants.
2. provide meta-narrative logic[^1] (values and principles) to develop, sustain, and scale community-based organizations with less hierarchy , %%through a variety of organizational structures%%, to a large and diverse group of participants.
3. optimizing use of blockchain and other Web3 tech, and other computational tools, to assist or support governance and operations in organizations[^2] [^4], and to help organizations implement more equitable forms of ownership and democratic forms of governance
4. govern socio-technical systems through Nearly Decentralized Organizations (NDOs)[^3]
5. balance human-machine governance of organizations (or [balance on- and off-chain rules and logic for organizations](https://orca.mirror.xyz/T70CmuhX95ubkw_JHOxSEy8d_EFeYXgtJnF13mPtaZE)), and further the resilience of [NDOs](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3959703)
6. meta-narrative logic (values and principles), to ensure use of Web3 tech does not [re-invent issues with Big Tech and surveillance capitalism](https://p2pmodels.eu/wp-content/uploads/whitepaper_p2pmodels.pdf)[^1]
7. take positives from corporate governance and self-management organizations, augment with Web3 tech, and help organizations implement more equitable forms of ownership and democratic forms of governance

%%@charles: What do you think about the second paragraph? More of the broader tech ecosystem goal, reflecting Web3's (from Ethereum's viewpoint and even Fediverse (e.g., Mastodon)) broader goal?%%

In doing so, DAOs show that these alternative forms of organizing are viable models against the traditional BigTech model of venture-backed startup, and should assist in providing institutional infrastructure for aligning human values with innovation trajectories or technological progress, to avoid the social harms associated with BigTech.

The Web3 ethos is (refer to ethereum whitepaper) (can just say that it is implied from the principles?)

## Main Questions to answer as part of DAO Index (can remove)

The main questions we seek to address/answer/investigate through the DAO Index are:

1. ...

### Questions addressed in V0.9
For V0.9, the questions we were able to answer or work on were:

1. Is the DAO Index questionnaire generalizable (or applicable to DAOs without consideration of organizational differences (size, mission, industry, etc.))?
