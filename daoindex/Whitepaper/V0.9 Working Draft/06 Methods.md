## Data Collection 

- Purposeful Sampling Strategy %%is this exploratory case study research? In addition to deriving insights from the literature for principles%%
	- Why the 10 DAOs
	- Generalizability 
- How we conducted the assessment 
- Literature Collection? %%sporadic at best. Not a systematic collection %%
- %%can say overall method is: first step is to collect literature to find principles/ideals (that we prefer?) and posible questions, and second step is to use quesitonnaire to get info back like an exploratory case study%%
## Data Analysis

- Assessment Results Analysis
- Instrument Validity Checks
	- Validity checks
		- External: question independence
	- Reliability checks
		- Internal check: Inter-rater reliability
	- consistency checks
		- Internal consistency

# Prose

## Literature Collection (can rename to literature review; can move to its own section)

%%may need a more formal method for literature review%%

We collected academic and grey literature to help identify %%or design principles%% principles  %%or search literature to find docs on principles and pick appropriate ones from there? Or for how to develop design principles?%% for how DAOs should be designed (or operated and governed) %%or expected characteristics%%. Additionally, to identify current issues facing DAOs.

We collected academic and grey literature to help identify questions (or criteria) relevant to assessing a DAO, including issues faced by DAOs in practice, and to identify principles for guidance on how DAOs should be operated and governed. 

You can find our collection of literature for each principle, and the snippets (or highlighted quotes) from each item in the table below. %%probably do not need snippets, just references. Same for questions.%%

%%The DAO Index helps focus on 1) how to design DAOs, and 2) how to assess DAOs. %%



## Literature Analysis

%%may need to do a thematic analysis as well? Refer to https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=889127119117085066065107068115100104036009058007026037005120121009020093073088028087018123040104049123008009109030002085082097001008088038013095101067031090117023006005066077104094106084108000006011031118004006017108096026011073117102006079000114022074&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE%%

%%Then, from the literature, we extracted snippets (or highlights quotes) from the articles, which better informed us of criteria for evaluating DAOs and principles that would be appropriate and universal (mission-, size-, and profit-independent) for DAOs.

We identified which principles and questions to keep or drop in each version of the DAO Index, based on our exploratory case studies conducted with the questionnaire, to see if we could connect the principles with real-world practices (or see how and if the principles could be interpreted in the real world (and any patterns for doing so)).%%


## Data Collection

We conducted eleven assessments with the DAO Index Questionnaire Version 0.9. We generated our responses by answering each question in the questionnaire for each DAO evaluated (i.e., conducting a draft assessment).

We based our responses on publicly available information provided directly (or primary source) by the DAO evaluated, or indirectly by a third party source (secondary source).

You can find our data sources in the table below.

[table]

We selected eleven DAOs of varying ownership and governance structures, missions, industry verticals, etc., to see the universality of the questionnaire (i.e., how often the questions were inapplicable to a particular organization).

You can find a table of the DAOs and their characteristics from DeepDAO and [name of other data sources] below.

%%What characteristics to include?%%

## Data Analysis

### Assessment Results
We conducted the following analyses on the draft assessments (refer to Analysis notebook; results of analysis notebook should be included in Findings section):

1. examined the correlation of responses (for question independence?)
2. created radar charts for each DAO based on their scores per principle
3. created a bar chart of each DAO's overall score
3. created a bar chart of each DAO's scores per principle
5. created a scores table for overall scores and scores per principle for all DAOs assessed
6. created a table counting the number of questions where no information could be found to answer the question
7. created a table counting the number of questions inapplicable to a DAO

## Instrument (or Survey) Analysis
We conducted the following analyses on the Questionnaire, as of Version 0.9:

1. conducted Chronbach's Alpha to determine internal consistency
2. conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the important factors[^1][^2]
3. %%?determined areas of improvement for the questionnaire?%%
