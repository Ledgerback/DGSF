## Developing the DAO Index

- Question Independence 
	- principles 
	- indicators  
- translate academic and industry findings into actionable questions, that fit under the principles
- why yes/no questions?


```markdown
The [principles](https://force11.org/fsci/post/principles/) can be used as:

1. a framework for an agreement between researchers, funders, publishers, librarians, citizen scientists and others active in science and scholarship on how to make research open and participatory for anyone, anywhere
2. a guide to decide how to practice and support research
3. a basis for badging of activities as commons-compliant, by individuals and organizations


The principles themselves do not describe what the scholarly commons should look like and how it should be organized and governed. That is up to participants to decide, using the principles to guide their practices. This can involve choosing existing systems and platforms to carry out and disseminate research, as well as creating new solutions.

## Solution: DAO Index

To help DAOs (or organizations claiming to be DAOs) 

To help resolve the DAO misalignment problem, we have developed the DAO Index, a set of organizing principles (*need to define principles*), operationalized as a questionnaire.

We promote adherence to the DAO Index principles through a ranking and monitoring platform, available as a web UI, of assessments completed with the DAO Index questionnaire.

### Values?

- thoughts?
	- Web3 ethos in an organizaiontal context? Somewaht combining cypherpunk with cooperative values?
	- any need to mention? Or just approach like POSI?

### Principles

Is it possible to derive values from the principles?

#### Table
The principles, as of Version 0.9, and the description and rationale for each principle, are described in the table below.

<iframe class="airtable-embed" src="https://airtable.com/embed/appD5ab5jcYsnDLeI/shrLk0QJoD6KrPdr0?backgroundColor=green&viewControls=on" frameborder="0" onmousewheel="" width="100%" height="533" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>
#### Purposes
The principles are meant to act as: 

1. general guidelines (need a cite) for how an organization can implement practices to align itself with DAO expectations (or with web3 ethos or overarching goal of being a counter-instution or with [our vision of DAOs](https://force11.org/fsci/post/principles/) )
2. a meeting place (or framework for agreement between) for academia, industry, and society to determine practices or norms for organizing as a DAO[^1]
3. a guide for organizing as a DAO
4. universal stanadrd for organization design that should constitute a DAO
5. a standard for norms on how to organize as a DAO
6. a basis for developing organizing standards for DAOs that can eb adapted to fit more specific contexts
7. a basis for determingin if an organization's practices and design is embracing DAO expectations
8. a basis for badging an organization's practices and design as embracing DAO expectations or DAO-compliant, for individuals and organizations
9. a set of ideals for how DAOs should operate
9. a set of ideals for how DAOs should be designed
10. describe characteristics of a DAO %%(given OD goal?)%%

### Discussion

Can include references to how we describe principles (more a lit. synthesis?), and what we hope for them to do as a general guideline for DAOs. (pretty much, how we came up with principle)

From here, maybe get the concepts and themes, and how they end up in principle (or how to group principles under themes).

outline:

1. principle description
2. lit. that lead to principle

Can say principles are like co-op principles? And refer to jen radebaugh article and dymitro dexe protcol guy's article in that there is a need for principles

The principles are as a set of ideals (or simply key domains to assess DAOs?) for the operation of DAOs, similar to the Rochdale Principles for cooperatives.[^10]

Currently, there is not a set of ideals (or meta-narrative logic) to guide the operation of DAOs, especially towards the OD goal, and for balancing the social and technical sides of DAOs.[^11] [^12]

The principles generally emerged from our observations of DAOs and the DAO ecosystem and insights garnered from the academic and grey literature %%somewhat finding themes in literature; or going somewhat from empirical-to-conceptual%%.



In general, we selected principles we believed to be ?critical themes? or important areas of concern (or core drivers and ideals (referring to idealistic vision of DAOs?)) for designing DAOs or we beleived to be 1) universal or generic or foundational to all DAOs, and 2) provide general guidelines, to how a DAO should be operated and governed. %%or simply generalizing from literature we found relevant in developing the DAO Index%%

%%hmm, may need to improve research process for developing principles or ideals, like DAOmeter? https://daometer.vercel.app/methodology%%

%%The principles generally emerged from observations of DAOs and the DAO ecosystem, detailed (or documented) in the academic and grey literature.%%


In the following paragraphs, we describe the literature that led to us developing the principle (or ideal) for DAOs. **Or isntead, here is our snippets/quotes table descrbinnig the quotes we extracted from the literature, and the principles the quote was classified under.** %%Do the same for questions%%

Our literature spans many different disciplines, including ...

#### BSP

In general, most small tokenholders cannot meanignully (i.e., any actions they take are not determinative in the outcome of a decision) participate in a DAO.

#### HCAG

>The use of algorithmic (or automated) systems in governance should support human decision-making and humane practices, rather than replacing or removing humans from governance. In other words, preventing a DAO’s use of algorithmic decision-making to lead to the DAO becoming a panopticon or the downfall of the DAO.

HCAG was included as a principle, as of Version 0.9, because we believe that DAOs should utilize algorithmic governance, in addition to social governance, in a way that is human-centered (i.e., reduces risks to DAO participants, acknowledging the subjectivity of algorithm development, and making algorithms more explainable given the DAO's objective for the algorithm).

Our rationale is supported by or we based our rationale on 

1. Is a "Decentralized Autonomous Organization" a Panopticon?: Algorithmic governance as creating and mitigating vulnerabilities in DAOs

In *Is a "Decentralized Autonomous Organization" a Panopticon?: Algorithmic governance as creating and mitigating vulnerabilities in DAOs*, Kelsie Nabben discusses how algorithmic governance in DAOs can create and mitigate vulnerabilities in DAOs, with a case study on the use of algorithmic reputation in Gitcoin. 

%% use this as template for lit. used for principles%%
Nabben highlights ...

Important themes or snippets from the paper include:

1. > I argue that humans and algorithms are co-constitutive, and the difference between algorithmic governance in DAOs and existing digital platforms is that creation and amendment of the rules is participatory in nature.
2. > This subjectivity makes setting the rules of decentralized governance systems akin to the practice of policy making, in which algorithms perform and execute instructions in the way that they are encoded to do so to conduct governance functions [29].
3. 

possibel enw questions:

1. does the DAO allow for creation of sub-communities or -groups?
2. does the DAO nurture an ownership or stewardship culture?

Refer to https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=103001127120080068083065118085076064054034061037083025066007080010002122023064006120098060061014119026053127090069082100086115041004031050048090071003088100100028098042059073027085006100065007021090080112118031107026105123077028013011124126117007093082&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE 

### Questionnaire
The questionnaire operationalizes the principles, thereby providing a means for setting measurable expectations for DAO organizing (or design components for DAOs) (i.e., an assessment model for the principles and a means for sharing evidence on adherence). 

The questionnaire assesses adherence to the principles, through a set of indicators and questions for each principle.

The indicator acts as a category or signal for identifying deisgn choices in DAOs, and the question is a specific inqiurity, generally following from the indicator, about a DAO's design choices (or design components).

The questions help connect/bridge the vision of DAOs to real-world practices, by helping %%to interpret the principle,%% to identify design choices/components (and practices embedding those design choices) that can be implemented to reach the DAO vision, generally by deriving insights from DAO-related academic and grey literature.

%%The questions serve as an interpretation of the principle?%%

The questions are designed to be independent, such that the answer or response to one question does not depend on the answer to another question. 


#### Questionnaire V0.9

You can find the Questionnaire, as of Version 0.9 (V0.9), in the table below, including the rationale for each question.

#### Glossary

You can find the definitions for terms used in the questionnaire in the table below.

<iframe class="airtable-embed" src="https://airtable.com/embed/appD5ab5jcYsnDLeI/shrrSChfUj0Yw2e4o?backgroundColor=green&viewControls=on" frameborder="0" onmousewheel="" width="100%" height="533" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>

#### Assessment Process

The DAO Index assessment is a meticulous six-step procedure designed to ensure accuracy, transparency, and active participation from the DAO community. The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Initial Draft Assessment**: Utilizing the DAO Index Questionnaire, we conduct an initial assessment based on publicly available information about a DAO. This stage forms the foundation of our analysis.
2. **Draft Publication**: The initial assessment findings are then published on the DAO Index Dashboard. Additionally, a comprehensive write-up detailing this preliminary evaluation is made available for public viewing and feedback.
3. **Community Engagement**: In this critical phase, we actively engage with representatives from the DAO under review. Their insights and feedback on both the DAO Index and the draft assessment are solicited to ensure a well-rounded evaluation.
4. **Final Assessment Compilation**: The final assessment integrates feedback received in the previous step. It also considers any new information or developments that have emerged since the initial assessment, ensuring the final report is up-to-date and reflective of the latest DAO dynamics.
5. **Final Assessment Dissemination**: Similar to the draft stage, the final assessment is published on the DAO Index Dashboard for transparency. A detailed write-up, encompassing all the insights and conclusions from the entire assessment process, is also made publicly available.
6. **Ongoing Review Cycle**: Recognizing the dynamic nature of DAOs, this step involves revisiting and reassessing DAOs periodically. This iterative approach ensures that the DAO Index remains relevant and accurately reflects the evolving landscape of DAO governance.

#### Scoring

As of Version 0.9, responses are scored using the following method:

Every question has a maximum of 100 points.

The score or overall score is produced from summing the points received for every question.

Currently, there are no weights applied to scores per principle, nor are scores multiplied to have the same total %%need name of this technique%%.

#### Gradio Web UI (can remove)

In development is a Gradio web UI (can link to Airtable via API) for assessing organizations using the questionnaire.

#### User Guide (can remove or add to appendix)

We developed a user guide to aid analysts (or auditors) in using the DAO Index questionnaire V0.8.

#### Scorecard Toolkit (probably do not need to mention tools here; mention in appendix) (possible to make as a Notion Template?)

### Dashboard

The DAO Index dashboard is a publicly accessible, web-based user interface (UI) for querying and filtering DAO Index ratings and the DAO Index data repository (completed assessments, materials cited), and finding DAO Index-related resources.

Through the dashboard, anyone can monitor DAOs ??? %%Need to think about how people can use the dashboard%%

You can see an image of each webpage below or in the appendix.

### Data repository

*Can include graphic from slidedeck*

The data repository is a library of DAO Index-related datasets.

The data repository includes the following datasets:

1. Materials or Evidence dataset: a dataset of materials cited in DAO Index assessments with the questionnaire
2. Assessments dataset: a dataset of DAO Index assessments (or completed questionnaires)
3. Scores dataset: a dataset of DAO Index scores
4. Literature dataset: a dataset of academic and grey literature on DAOs (can remove)
5. Practices dataset: a dataset covering DAO-related practices (may not need if we can just refer to Govbase)

### Open data and participatory design approach (maybe move to benefits section)

Through an open data/access approach, we can provide transparency on how the DAO Index is developed and how DAOs are assessed with the DAO Index questionnaire.

Through a particiaptory design approach, we can encourage and collate ideas and other feedback from members of academia, industry, and the public on the DAO Index principles, and how they are operationalized through the questionnaire.

### Question (or Idea) Pool

We also host a question pool, for potential questions to add to the DAO Index questionnaire.

You can find it here.

Anyone can add a question to the question pool. 
## How the DAO Index was developed (is this needed? If so, in this section or another section?)

Initilaly, the questionnaire was devloped by generating questions then, grouping the questions based on a principle.

Generally, quesitons were generated from drawing insights from academic and/or grey literature (from any discipline and industry vertical for DAOs), that better informed us of design choices for DAOs. Similarly for the principles. 

After developing a set of questions, we grouped or categorized the questions based on a design principle, that we felt would serve as an important guideline for DAO practices.

~~We selected questions to be added to the questionnaire, that we believe were good interpretations of the principles.~~

%% can also say questions act as criteria for adhering to principles?%%


We continued to see how applicable or useful the principles and the questions in the questionnaire were from conducting assessments (or exploratory case studies), and updating the DAO Index principles and questionnaire, based on feedback from assessors, DAO operators we contacted about assessments, and interviews with third parties.
## How DAO Index addresses the problem statement

The DAO Index addresses the problem statement in the following ways:

1. **Transparency Poverty**: The DAO Index addresses transparency poverty by making data from assessments open access, and unearthing important information, that should be publicly known, through the assessment process. Additionaly, by highltiing the need for improvements in documentation for DAOs.
2. **Lack of Measurable Expectations**: The DAO Index addresses the lack of measurable expecations by operaitonalziing the principles through the questonnaire, with most questions seeking or enforcing a design choice that can be met through a spectrum of practicies (some exceptions such as BSP-02 and BSP-01)
3. **Conceptual Opacity**: The DAO Index addresses concepcutal opacity through the principles and the particiaptory design approach for the principles and questionnaire by encouraging collective input from members of academia, industry, and the public on the set of principles and how they are operationalized through the questionnaire
4. **Regression to the code**: The DAO Index addresses regression to the code by highlighting design compoenetns for developing social infrastructure (or norms and practices), while balancing the use of Web3 technolgoy for optimizing operations and governance (primarily throguh the OT principle). In other words, balancing trustware with socialware.
5. **Weak Learning**: The DAO Index addresses weak learning by providing open access (or open data approach) to the DAO Index data repository. Specifically, the best practices and literature datasets include best practices or good examples for DAOs to follow, while also tracking failures (cite other internet) and other incidents in the literature dataset. Furthermore,

### principles, not rules

The principles act as guidelines, but are not prescriptive in determining how an organization puts them into practice.[^1]



This allows for organizations implemeting the principles to be adaptive to their local challenges, changing circumstances and ever-growing complexity.[^2]

> All these systems have tangled, nested structures; it’s complicated all the way down. Delegation of authority and trust to those closest to the action is unavoidable. Top-level managers have little knowledge of, and influence over, the crucial details. Further, adaptive systems produce endless surprises, and it is hard (often impossible) to trace effect back to cause. We cannot really explain why we are in our current situation, and we cannot predict the consequences of our actions. Policy flexibility, leavened with a good dose of humility, is the only way to cope with such change. Finally, complexity brings fragility. Resilience can be improved by ensuring diversity of participants, big and small (although the occasional collapse, just like a major forest fire, is necessary for renewal and reinvention).

> Such principles can guide policy-making. Applied to the regulation of video services, for example, the delegation principle suggests that regulators look to web participants to generate content in local languages before imposing national production quotas. The flexibility principle implies that they should give content providers a chance to invent web-appropriate solutions to public-interest mandates, such as accessibility for the disabled, and only regulate to the extent that the community does not solve the problem. Finally, the diversity principle suggests that a multiplicity of creators is more likely to generate sustainable social value than a small number of heavily regulated producers; market entry and competition are key.

> The governance choice here is between principles and rules – that is, between general guidelines for action and detailed if-then instructions. Principles are not tacit: they are an expression of our shared insights about managing a resource. However, principles are silent about how they should be implemented in a specific situation. This delegates power to a local decision-maker to respond appropriately to conditions that a high-level policy maker could not foresee (or, indeed, cannot see). General principles can become more specific when they guide short-term actions. For example, someone setting high-level policy would implement the flexibility principle by focusing on broadly defined ends and not specifying means, while a regulator would devise specific, but still technology- and business-model-neutral, rules.

> Why principles and not rules? Regulators have no choice but to make it up as they go along when coping with rapidly changing systems. Principles guide decisions without relying on rules that will be obsolete before their ink has dried. We should not expect perfection from principles – just better results than could be achieved with either fleetingly relevant rules, or giving regulators complete discretion.

_

the principles are generally derived from groupin the questions, and from insights from academic and grey literature.


### scope is spectrum of activities
The use of pass/fail questions (though, any question type can be used (refer to limesurvey)) is primarily to first understand the spectrum of design choices (or practices), given the principles, that are possible. The principles are ment to be general guidleines, thus allowing for organizations to choose *multiple/different means to achieve multiple/different ends* (or to account for organizational differences). Thus, the DAO Index is indepdennt from profit- and mission-motivations.

Once we have a better understnading of the spectrum of activities that make sense for DAO design choices (or components), i.e., once we have acuqired enough qualitivies insights (cite vogshmir here), we can then create more precise questions, qualitative or quantaitative, in the future.

include applicable benefits or features from [NGLP_PrinciplesValues_WHITE PAPER](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1We01RHGV2XQi-UZpNkJuOYpfztqF4oavYbNjlFABFp4/edit#heading=h.tz6xy4ga36dg) and why this method may be good

### benchmarking

Individuals and insitutions (DAOs included) can see how DAOs are benchmarked, both against previous assessments and against other organizations.[^3]

We seek to incentivize DAOs to further align their diesng chocies with the DAO Index over time, prmiarily through a rating and ranking system based on scores from the assessment process, and publishing promotional materials such as blog posts and furnishing badges or rating labels for DAOs to promote their scores.[^3]

### Open data

Through an open data/access approach, we can provide transparency on how the DAO Index is developed and how DAOs are assessed with the DAO Index questionnaire.

### Participatory Design (or Co-design)
Through a particiaptory design approach, we can encourage and collate ideas and other feedback from members of academia, industry, and the public on the DAO Index principles, and how they are operationalized through the questionnaire.
### conformant with other design thinking frameworks

The principles are also generally conformant with toher deisgn thinking frameworks, such as Kelsie Nabben's [Dao Design Patterns](https://kelsienabben.substack.com/p/dao-design-patterns), *and possibly Shermin Vogshmir's DAO design thinking framework*.[^4]

[Exploring DAOs as a New Kind of Institution | by Joshua Tan | Commons Stack | Medium](https://medium.com/commonsstack/exploring-daos-as-a-new-kind-of-institution-8103e6b156d4)**

### Living Standard

The DAO Index is meant to be a living standard, such that it evolves with advancements in academia and industry.

The DAO Index will undergo periodic evaluation to determine necessary updates (additions, deletions, modifications), as determined by the core team (though, would like to have an advisory board here as well).

Additionally, the assessment process allows for feedback from external stakeholders (researchers, DAO operators, the public) on assessments, providing valuable information on what updates to include and prioritize for new versions of the DAO Index.

%% What else to include here?%%

### translation of academic and grey literature into actionable recommendations (or actionable knowledge) (can also say increasing the impact of research and researchers here) 

Our approach also amplifies or increases the impact of academic and grey literature by translating or deriving insights from the literature, and subseuqntly translating those insights into new question items in the DAO Index question pool, for consideration to be added to the DAO Index questionnaire. Thus, we turn the literature into actinoable knowledge or actionable recommendations, and monitor conformance or adherence to those recommendations.

### DAO Index can be adapted to fit more specific circumstances

The DAO Index questionnaire can be adapted by external stakeholders to meet their specific circumstances. In other words, external stakeholders can use the DAO Index principles and questionnaire as a base for developing their own values and principles, and measurement criteria.[^3]

Additionally, if an external stakeholder only finds certain principles or questions relevant to their circumstances, they can focus on only those principles

### identify best practices (or good/design patterns)

Through the DAO Index assessments, we can identify the practices of DAOs that adhere or do not adhere to the principles. Through that, we can catalogue DAO-related practices, and eventually surface best practices (or institutional improvements[^9] or patterns for organizing[^13]) that can be used as a guide for DAO operators in improving or building their DAOs.

### foster institutional innovation

The DAO Index can encourage or will foster institutional innovation[^5]  with Web3 tech, aligned with the OD goal by ranking and monitoring adherence to the DAO Index principles, and highlighting best practices that pushes organizations closer to the OD goal.[^5] 

Additionally, through the OT principle, we will search for ways to better balance the use of Web3 tech (or find how it can optimize governance and operations) while developing a strong social layer in DAOs[^8], so that the DAO does not simply become an excuse to play with Web3 tech[^6][^7], but an organization aligned with the OD goal, focused on achieving its mission and goals. 

This benefit also benefits the movement towards an open web through new institutional structures.

### make aspirational goals transparent or apparent

Through the DAO Index principles and questionnaire, we can also make aspirational goals or visions for DAOs apparent or transparent, and see if it is possible to connect real-world practices of DAOs to these visions.

### improve member agency (over self-governance and -infrastructuring)?

### improve stakeholder alignment?

### improve integrity?

### incorporate qualitative and quantitative measures

Through the DAO Index principles and questionnaire, we can incorporate qualitative and quantitative measures relevant to DAOs, (with any constraints or restrictions included in a question), thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of DAOs.

### help determine what a DAO should look like (can remove)

> [What should a shared infrastructure look like?](https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/)

### form the basis for an info reporting standard (or DAO communication standard)
