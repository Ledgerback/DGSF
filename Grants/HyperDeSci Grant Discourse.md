Distributed Governance Score Framework: DAO Index

Anyone knows founders? The project applied on Optimism. It sounds like a really cool project, but it feels like not related to DeSci 

If the founders on chat - plz explain how your project is related to DeSci.

Sorry, but without that the project can't be accepted.

FYI HyperDeSci is the first experiment, there would be other Hyper* rounds

Hi @ionrod @hyperdesci

Thank you @raimbetov for informing me of this concern with the DGSF application.

I am the founder and project lead for the DGSF project.

Though, our project is primarily social science research, we believe that DeSci is antidisciplinary, and like Open Science, focuses on how research is practiced.

We believe our project is a DeSci project because:

Mainly focusing on the open data and participatory nature of the project.

1. We make our datasets publicly available on GitHub, which you can find here: https://github.com/Ledgerback/DGSF/tree/main/Assessment%20Files. Additionally, we make our data explorable on our (work-in-progress) dashboard, which you can find here: https://joan816.softr.app/.
3. We practice a participatory approach to developing the DAO Index (our set of principles, operationalized as a questionnaire), by requesting and incorporating feedback from DAO operators, academic and independent researchers, and the general public, in developing the DAO Index's research methods and tools.
5. We share our early-stage and finished publications freely on PubPub, available here: https://ledgerback.pubpub.org/dgsf. Also, refer to our writeup on a preliminary assessment of Uniswap, available here: https://ledgerback.pubpub.org/pub/dxcy2zjr

%%
We are currently re-organizing our operations, so some of our work processes and tools are not publicly available yet.
