Distributed Governance Score Framework: DAO Index

Anyone knows founders? The project applied on Optimism. It sounds like a really cool project, but it feels like not related to DeSci 

If the founders on chat - plz explain how your project is related to DeSci.

Sorry, but without that the project can't be accepted.

FYI HyperDeSci is the first experiment, there would be other Hyper* rounds

Hi @ionrod @hyperdesci

Thank you @raimbetov for informing me of this concern with the DGSF application.

I am the founder and project lead for the DGSF project.

1. We practice open data by making our datasets publicly available on GitHub, which you can find here: ... . Additionally, we make our data explorable on our dashboard, which you can find here: ....
2. We invite anyone from society, industry, and academia to comment on our work and become a contributor on the project
3. We practice a participatory approach to the DAO Index (organizing philosophy memorialized as a set of principles, operationalized as a questionnaire), by 
	1. requesting feedback from members of DAOs we have assessed, 
	2. (planned) inviting those members to add new features onto our roadmap
	3. incorporating feedback from members of society, academia, and industry to develop the DAO Index
4. We practice a *learn/build in public* approach, whereby we publish publicly our results from our work, such as our writeup on a preliminary assessment of Uniswap, available here:

We are currently re-organizing our operations, so some of our work processes and tools are not publicly available yet.
