### **What are you making?**

Keep it simple and write in the first person, e.g. "I'm making a documentary film about the AI Safety..."

Possibly:
1. An open and participatory framework to re-define how organizations assess their alignment with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).
2. I am making an open ratings platform for DAO practices, centered on a set of principles, i.e., an organizing philosophy, and organizational design dimensions
3. I am making an open and participatory framework to define an a set of principles, i.e., an organizing philosophy, and organizational design dimensions for DAO practices %%like cooperatives?%%, operationalized as a questionnaire to assess adherence to the organizing philosophy and provide guidance on DAO-oriented practices.
### **How will your project impact the world?**

**Tell us how your project will transform lives, revitalize communities, or regenerate ecosystems.**

#### Desired Outcomes
##### Short-Term Impact

- **Research Publication and Dissemination**: We will generate a comprehensive research paper and series of accessible blog posts detailing the DAO Index's methodologies, insights, and broader implications under the umbrella of DGSF. These publications will establish foundational knowledge in DAO governance effectiveness.
- **Collaborative Development**: Regular collaborative sessions will invite diverse expertise, including researchers and DAO practitioners, to contribute to the DAO Index's evolution, ensuring its alignment with the goals and principles of DGSF.

##### Long-Term Impact

The DAO Index, as a key component of the Distributed Governance Score Framework (DGSF), is set to have transformative long-term impacts in the realm of DAO governance:

- **DGSF-Driven Standardization and Benchmarking**: By setting benchmarks for evaluating DAOs under the DGSF, the DAO Index will standardize governance models across the sector, enhancing clarity and informed decision-making in the DAO community.
- **Facilitating Evolution of DAOs through DGSF**: As part of DGSF, the DAO Index will be instrumental in driving the evolution of DAOs, offering insights to develop more democratic, transparent, and efficient governance systems.
- **Influencing Policy and Practice with DGSF Insights**: Insights generated by the DAO Index within the DGSF framework will have the potential to influence policy and practical governance models, impacting the broader decentralized organization landscape.
- **AI Integration for Scalable Governance Analysis**: Aligning with DGSF's vision, the DAO Index will incorporate AI-based tools, such as in the MakerDAO initiative, to scale governance evaluation. This integration of manual and AI-driven analysis will ensure comprehensive and accurate assessments.


%%Pretty much who we serve%%

#### Who we serve


Our project will provide benefits to everyone in society. 

Though, we believe our project will provide benefits to these stakeholders the most:

1. **Researchers**: The DAO Index is an invaluable tool for academic and industry research, providing a comprehensive blend of data-driven insights and qualitative analysis. This rich resource aids in exploring the intricacies of DAO governance and operational dynamics beyond mere on-chain data.
2. **The Public**: For those seeking clarity in the complex world of DAOs, the DAO Index offers an accessible platform. It employs visual labels and badges to represent DAO Index ratings, simplifying the comparison and understanding of different DAOs for the layperson.
3. **Businesses and Investors**: The Index serves as a crucial reference for businesses and investors interested in the DAO sector, providing a holistic view of governance practices. By combining qualitative assessments with quantitative data, it offers a robust foundation for informed decision-making and strategic investments.
4. **DAOs**: DAOs can use the Index to benchmark their governance and organizational structures against broader industry practices. The Index's comprehensive approach, spotlighting best practices and case studies, showcases exemplary governance models and guides DAOs in refining their practices for better transparency and efficiency.

### **What progress have you made?**

**Highlight anything that shows momentum. Have you raised money? Shipped code? Assembled an impressive team?**

Concerning fundraising, we have raised ~$432.00 from participating in the MetaGov Governance Research round on Gitcoin. 

Concerning our outputs, we have published the following outputs:

1. Pitchdeck: A pitchdeck providing an overview on the DGSF project. You can find it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tg0421j_ktrorTFGYNdhaVx_wzZ0Fow359DI1uiAdR4/edit?usp=sharing.
2. Dashboard: a web-based user interface for exploring the DAO Index ratings and data repository. You can find it here: https://joan816.softr.app/
3. Write-ups: we publish write-ups on our DAO Index assessments. You can find an example write-up on our analysis of Uniswap with the DAO Index questionnaire here: https://ledgerback.pubpub.org/pub/dxcy2zjr/release/4
4. DAO Index Analysis Toolkit: a Jupyter notebook covering an analysis of DAO Index scores. You can find it here:  https://github.com/Ledgerback/DGSF/blob/main/Data%20Analysis/DGSF_DAO_Index_Analysis_Toolkit_2023_09_14_V03_Public.ipynb
5. Computing the Banzhaf Power Index: a short publication detaling our work calculating the Baznhaf Power Index scores for Gitcoin (GTC) token holders in ???, available here:

We recently increased our team size to 3 people. Myself (Charles Adjovu), Xule Lin, and Valerie Spina. 

We plan to recruit more people in the immediate future to help out on the project.


### **Why are you the right person to make this project?**

**What about your background makes you uniquely suited to create this project?**

%%

How am I suppose to know this? Hahaha

Actually, it may be better for Xule to take the lead role for this application, hahaha.

### **Start Date**

**When did you first start working on your project?**

January 2020

### **Expected Completion Date**

**When do you expect to complete your project?**


For our work on transitioning the DAO Index to V1.0, we expect to finish the transition mid-summer. 

The project technically does not have a completed date because we intend for the DAO Index to be a living standard to guide DAO practices.
