### **What are you making?**

Keep it simple and write in the first person, e.g. "I'm making a documentary film about the AI Safety..."

Possibly:

3. I am making an open and participatory framework to re-define how organizations assess their alignment with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). %%can say daos are more of a philosophy then %%
### **How will your project impact the world?**

**Tell us how your project will transform lives, revitalize communities, or regenerate ecosystems.**


In general, we expect the DGSF project to have the following impact(s):

1. Increased transparency around DAO activities, especially regarding off-chain activities, 
2. Providing qualitative insights, in addition to quantitative insights , to provide a greater or more holistic understanding of DAOs
3. Causing a change in DAO norms towards greater transparency, democratic governance, equitable ownership, and participatory operations.
4. Provide a framework for agreement between academia, industry, and society to determine best practices and norms for organizing as a DAO
5. Strengthening the social layer of DAOs so that DAOs can better handle and respond to unexpected emergencies or vulnerabilities that arise that cannot be resolved solely through smart contracts
6. Fostering prosocial behavior in DAO practices by aligning real-world practices with the idealized vision of DAOs
7. Providing a standard for organizing as a DAO, so that DAOs can be further designed or specialized to fit specific contexts, such as developing open source software or governing a commons
8. Providing an open data repository of DAO practices from our assessments, to improve the learning rate of the DAO ecosystem, so that new and existing DAO founders and operators can develop their DAOs based on following the best practices or avoiding the worst practices of DAOs before them.
9. Providing ratings and badges to help the public understand DAOs, and for potential DAO members to determine which DAOs to join


We also believe that our project will provide the most benefit to these stakeholders:

1. **Researchers**: The DAO Index is an invaluable tool for academic and industry research, providing a comprehensive blend of data-driven insights and qualitative analysis. This rich resource aids in exploring the intricacies of DAO governance and operational dynamics beyond mere on-chain data.
2. **The Public**: For those seeking clarity in the complex world of DAOs, the DAO Index offers an accessible platform. It employs visual labels and badges to represent DAO Index ratings, simplifying the comparison and understanding of different DAOs for the layperson.
3. **Businesses**: The DAO Index serves as a crucial reference for businesses and investors interested in the DAO sector, providing a holistic view of governance practices. By combining qualitative assessments with quantitative data, it offers a robust foundation for informed decision-making and strategic investments.
4. **DAOs**: DAOs can use the DAO Index to benchmark their governance and organizational structures against broader industry practices. The DAO Index's comprehensive approach, spotlighting best practices and case studies, showcases exemplary governance models and guides DAOs in refining their practices for better transparency and efficiency.

### **What progress have you made?**

**Highlight anything that shows momentum. Have you raised money? Shipped code? Assembled an impressive team?**

Concerning fundraising, we have raised ~$432.00 from participating in the MetaGov Governance Research round on Gitcoin. 

Concerning our work, we have published the following outputs:

1. Pitchdeck: A pitchdeck providing an overview of the DGSF project's aims and benefits, available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tg0421j_ktrorTFGYNdhaVx_wzZ0Fow359DI1uiAdR4/edit?usp=sharing.
2. DAO Index Dashboard: a prototype web-based user interface for exploring the DAO Index ratings and data repository, available here: https://joan816.softr.app/
3. Write-ups: we publish write-ups on our DAO Index assessments. You can find an example write-up on our analysis of Uniswap with the DAO Index questionnaire here: https://ledgerback.pubpub.org/pub/dxcy2zjr/release/4
4. DAO Index Scorecard Toolkit: an Airtable base for assessing tDAOs with the DAO Index Questionnaire V0.9, available here: https://airtable.com/appLWHWSN0Tf81C3V/shr7bQ5LcORabzm85
5. DAO Index Analysis Toolkit: a Jupyter notebook covering an analysis of DAO Index scores. You can find it here: https://github.com/Ledgerback/DGSF/blob/main/Data%20Analysis/DGSF_DAO_Index_Analysis_Toolkit_2023_09_14_V03_Public.ipynb

We recently increased our team size to 3 people. Myself (Charles Adjovu), Xule Lin, and Valerie Spina. 

We plan to recruit more people in the immediate future to help out on the project.


### **Why are you the right person to make this project?**

**What about your background makes you uniquely suited to create this project?**

%%

How am I suppose to know this? Hahaha

Actually, it may be better for Xule to take the lead role for this application, hahaha.

Background:

1. I have studied and researched how to develop an assessment framework for DAOs since 2020 (and consistently working on the DGSF since 2022)
3. This is a lived problem for me as I research DAOs, and more often than not, I ran into the issue of DAOs having inadequate to non-existent documentation, thereby making it hard to assess DAOs, and even more worrisome, the awful or ingratiating issue of trying to answer what is a DAO. 

### **Start Date**

**When did you first start working on your project?**

January 2020 (restarted in late 2021)

### **Expected Completion Date**

**When do you expect to complete your project?**

For our work on transitioning the DAO Index from V0.9 (current version) to V1.0, we expect to finish the transition (updated research methods, assessment tools, etc.) by the end of August 2024.

The project technically does not have an expected completion date because we intend for the DAO Index to be a living standard to guide DAO practices.
