**What is your project’s long term vision for civic impact?Public**

Through our framework, we hope to:

1. guide informed decision-making by DAO operators and DAO tooling developers;
2. provide a framework for agreement between members of academia, industry, and society on how DAOs should be governed and operated; and
3. improve real-world DAO practices by showing the gap between these practices and our idealized expectations of DAOs.


In doing so, we will achieve civic impact by having more DAOs: 1) implement community-based  organizing, thereby increasing the DAO's resilience; and 2) implementing new methods for participatory governance, thereby increasing individual agency in DAOs.

%%
In doing so, we achieve civic impact by enhancing the reslience of digital organizations by encouraging community-based organizing, and increase individual agency in digital organizations by promoting and identifying new methods for participatory governance.


Through our framework, operaitonzlied as a quesitonnaire, we will audit organizations (primarily DAOs) for community organizing and individual agency. By doing so, we will enhance resilience by promoting the adoption of community organizing and participatory governance systems in digital organizations.


Enhance resilience by promoting 

Increase individual agency in digital organizations by promoting and identifying new methods for participatory governance.
