The DGSF project is developing an open and participatory framework to re-define how organizations assess their alignment with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). At the heart of the DGSF project lies our tool, the DAO Index.

The key features of the DAO Index include:

- **Standardized Principles**: Offering a unified set of principles and language, DGSF enables clear measurement and reporting of an organization's alignment with DAO models.
    
- **Questionnaire**: As a practical application of DGSF, the DAO Index operationalizes these principles into a user-friendly tool, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world implementation of decentralized governance.

You can learn more about the DGSF project here in our grant for the Metagov Research Round: https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/0xa7608d95a93cc684f2719323d40cbd0f59afe7d4/0xa7608d95a93cc684f2719323d40cbd0f59afe7d4-26.
